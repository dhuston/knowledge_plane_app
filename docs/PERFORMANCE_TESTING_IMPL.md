# Performance Testing Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the automated performance testing and benchmarking for the Biosphere Alpha platform.

## Overview

The performance testing framework is designed to measure, benchmark, and optimize the performance of both frontend and backend components, with particular emphasis on the map visualization components which are critical for the application's performance.

## Components Implemented

### Backend Performance Testing

1. **Redis Cache Performance Testing (`test_redis_cache_performance.py`)**
   - Tests the efficiency of the neighbor caching system
   - Benchmarks spatial caching performance
   - Measures cache hit/miss timing and overhead
   - Verifies cache consistency under load

2. **Database Query Optimization (`test_db_query_performance.py`)**
   - Compares performance of different query strategies (Raw SQL vs. ORM)
   - Benchmarks spatial vs. relational query performance
   - Tests different relationship loading strategies
   - Compares pagination methods (offset-based vs. keyset-based)

3. **Locust Load Testing (`locustfile_map_cache.py`)**
   - Specialized locustfile focusing on caching effectiveness
   - Simulates realistic map interaction patterns
   - Measures performance with caching enabled vs. disabled
   - Collects detailed metrics on cache hit rates and response times
   - Tests different viewport and node selection patterns

4. **Test Runner Script (`run_performance_tests.py`)**
   - Orchestrates all performance tests for reproducible benchmarking
   - Generates comprehensive performance reports with charts
   - Provides options to run subsets of tests for faster iteration
   - Collects and visualizes performance metrics in standardized format

### Frontend Performance Testing (Previously Implemented)

1. **Lighthouse CI**
   - Automated performance testing for Core Web Vitals
   - Performance budgets for key metrics
   - Integration with GitHub Actions workflow

2. **Component Performance Testing**
   - Test utilities for React component performance
   - Benchmark harness for map components
   - Performance test configuration for Vitest

## Usage

### Running Backend Performance Tests

To run specific backend performance tests:

```bash
# Redis cache performance tests
poetry run pytest tests/performance/test_redis_cache_performance.py -v

# Database query performance tests
poetry run pytest tests/performance/test_db_query_performance.py -v

# Locust load tests
poetry run locust -f tests/performance/locustfile_map_cache.py
```

To run the complete test suite and generate a report:

```bash
poetry run python tests/performance/run_performance_tests.py
```

### Running Frontend Performance Tests

To run frontend performance tests:

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Run Lighthouse CI
npm run lhci

# Run component performance tests
npm run performance-test
```

## Key Metrics Monitored

### Backend Metrics

1. **API Response Times**
   - Raw response time
   - Time to first byte
   - Processing time
   - Database query time

2. **Caching Effectiveness**
   - Cache hit rate
   - Cache hit vs. miss response time
   - Cache memory utilization
   - Cache invalidation impact

3. **Database Performance**
   - Query execution time
   - Query plan efficiency
   - Index utilization
   - Connection pool utilization

4. **Scalability**
   - Response time under load
   - Throughput (requests per second)
   - Error rate under load
   - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)

### Frontend Metrics

1. **Core Web Vitals**
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
   - First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.8s

2. **Map Specific Metrics**
   - Initial render time: < 1s
   - Interaction response time: < 100ms
   - Frame rate during animations: > 30fps
   - Memory usage over time

## Continuous Integration

The performance tests are integrated with CI/CD workflows:

1. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Automated performance testing on Pull Requests
   - Performance regression detection
   - Benchmarking against baseline metrics

2. **Reporting**
   - Automated performance reports
   - Trend analysis over time
   - Visualization of key metrics
   - Alert on performance regressions

## Optimization Targets

Based on initial testing, the following optimization targets have been identified:

1. **Redis Cache Optimization**
   - Fine-tune cache TTL based on data volatility
   - Optimize memory usage for large spatial datasets
   - Implement adaptive caching based on access patterns

2. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Use spatial indexing for viewport-based queries
   - Implement keyset pagination for all paginated endpoints
   - Optimize eager loading to reduce N+1 query problems

3. **Application-level Optimizations**
   - Implement client-side spatial filtering for small movements
   - Use Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering based on zoom level
   - Implement progressive loading for large datasets

## Next Steps

1. Integrate performance metrics with monitoring system
2. Create performance dashboards for real-time monitoring
3. Implement automatic performance regression detection
4. Develop performance optimization recommendations based on collected data
5. Fine-tune caching strategies based on usage patterns
