# Epic 5.1: Organizational Hierarchy Navigator Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Organizational Hierarchy Navigator, a new feature that adds formal organizational structure visualization to complement the existing emergent collaboration views in our product. The feature will be implemented as a collapsible sidebar in the "My Work" area, allowing users to navigate up their reporting chain and understand their place within the formal organizational hierarchy.

## Current State Analysis

Based on the codebase review:

1. The existing user model has limited hierarchy information
2. Teams are implemented but without clear hierarchical relationships
3. Departments are referenced but need extension for full hierarchy support
4. The "My Work" area exists but doesn't provide organizational context
5. The current sidebar navigation doesn't include hierarchical navigation

## Data Model Enhancements

### Extend Department Model
```typescript
// Current simplified model
interface Department {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
}

// Extended model
interface Department {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  parentDepartmentId?: string; // For hierarchical structure
  leaderId?: string;           // Department head
  level: number;               // Hierarchy level (0 = org, 1 = division, etc.)
  metadata: {                  // Additional organizational metadata
    code?: string;             // Department code
    location?: string;         // Physical location
    function?: string;         // Functional area
  }
}
```

### Create OrganizationalUnit Abstract Type
```typescript
type OrganizationalUnitType = 'organization' | 'division' | 'department' | 'team';

interface OrganizationalUnit {
  id: string;
  type: OrganizationalUnitType;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  parentId?: string;
  leaderId?: string;
  memberCount: number;
  level: number;
  path: string[]; // Array of parent IDs for quick traversal
}
```

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Backend Updates

#### Database Schema Changes
- Add hierarchical relationship fields to departments table
- Create views for efficient hierarchy traversal
- Add indexes for performance optimization

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/hierarchy/path`: Get full path to root for current user
- `GET /api/v1/hierarchy/unit/{id}`: Get details for specific organizational unit
- `GET /api/v1/hierarchy/unit/{id}/children`: Get child units
- `GET /api/v1/hierarchy/unit/{id}/members`: Get members of unit

#### Services
- Create `OrganizationalHierarchyService` to handle hierarchy logic
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed hierarchy data
- Implement efficient tree traversal algorithms

### 2. Frontend Components

#### Component Structure
```
components/
├── hierarchy/
│   ├── HierarchyNavigator.tsx (main sidebar container)
│   ├── HierarchyItem.tsx (compact navigation item)
│   ├── HierarchyPopover.tsx (detail popover)
│   ├── HierarchySearch.tsx (search functionality)
│   ├── HierarchyContext.tsx (context provider)
│   └── popovers/
│       ├── TeamPopover.tsx
│       ├── DepartmentPopover.tsx
│       └── OrganizationPopover.tsx
```

#### State Management
- Create hierarchy-specific state management
- Implement caching for visited organizational units
- Add state synchronization with workspace content

#### Integration Points
- Add hierarchy sidebar to workspace layout
- Create toggle mechanism for sidebar visibility
- Implement content filtering based on selected organizational unit

### 3. User Interface Enhancements

#### Sidebar Design
- Implement collapsible sidebar container
- Create responsive design for all screen sizes
- Design transitions and animations

#### Hierarchy Navigation
- Implement chevron-style expandable navigation
- Create breadcrumb navigation for current path
- Add search and filter capabilities

#### Organizational Unit Views
- Design and implement team view component
- Create department view with relevant information
- Develop organization/division level views

### 4. Integration Features

#### Workspace Integration
- Add context filtering based on organizational unit
- Create "organizational lens" for workspace content
- Implement persistent sidebar state between sessions

#### Search Enhancement
- Extend global search to include organizational hierarchy
- Add type-ahead suggestions for organizational units
- Implement hierarchical result grouping

#### User Profile Connection
- Link user profiles to organizational positions
- Show reporting relationships on profile pages
- Add quick navigation to manager/reports

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. User loads "My Work" area
2. Application fetches user's organizational position
3. HierarchyNavigator initializes with user's position
4. User expands chevron to navigate up the hierarchy
5. Application lazily loads selected unit details
6. View components render based on selected unit type
7. Optional filtering applied to workspace content

### Caching Strategy

- Client-side cache for frequently accessed units
- Path-based prefetching for likely navigation targets
- Session persistence for hierarchy navigation state
- Invalidation on organizational changes

### Performance Considerations

- Virtualized lists for large organizational units
- Progressive loading of hierarchy details
- Memoization of expensive rendering operations
- Optimized state updates to prevent cascading renders

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each hierarchy component in isolation
   - Verify correct rendering for different unit types
   - Test navigation logic and state management

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between hierarchy and workspace
   - Verify correct data flow through the application
   - Test caching and performance optimizations

3. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Verify intuitive navigation in different organizational structures
   - Test with various organization depths and sizes
   - Validate performance with large datasets
