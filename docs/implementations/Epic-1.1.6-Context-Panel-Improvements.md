# 1.1.6 - Context Panel Improvements Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the context panels in the Living Map visualization to provide users with more detailed information about selected nodes. Context panels are critical UI elements that display details about people, teams, projects, and goals when users select nodes on the map.

## Current State Analysis
Based on the codebase review:
1. Basic node selection exists in the `LivingMap.tsx` component
2. `NodeTooltip.tsx` provides hover information but is limited
3. `BriefingPanel.tsx` exists as a more extensive panel but needs improvements
4. There's a need for consistent panel layouts across different entity types
5. The relationship visualization needs enhancement within panels

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Context Panel Architecture Refactoring
- Create a new unified `ContextPanel` component that handles all entity types
- Implement modular sub-components for different sections (header, details, relationships, actions)
- Develop consistent styling that aligns with the current design system
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

### 2. Entity-Specific Panel Components
- Implement specialized components for each entity type:
  - `UserContextPanel`: Display professional details, skills, team memberships
  - `TeamContextPanel`: Show team members, projects, department info
  - `ProjectContextPanel`: Present timeline, status, team members, goals
  - `GoalContextPanel`: Show progress, aligned projects, status

### 3. Relationship Visualization Enhancement
- Create a visual relationship component showing connections to other entities
- Implement consistent color-coding based on relationship types
- Add interactive elements to navigate to connected entities
- Group relationships by type for better organization

### 4. Rich Content Support
- Implement Markdown rendering for descriptions and notes
- Add support for embedded images and links in descriptions
- Create expandable sections for longer content
- Implement code highlighting for technical documentation

### 5. Activity Timeline Component
- Design and implement a timeline view for entity history
- Create activity cards for different action types
- Add filtering options by activity type
- Implement infinite scroll for historical activities

### 6. Action Button Implementation
- Create entity-specific action buttons (e.g., message user, join team)
- Implement proper permission checks for actions
- Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions
- Create tooltips explaining available actions

### 7. Entity Suggestions
- Implement ML-based entity suggestion algorithm
- Create UI component for suggested related entities
- Add explanation tooltips for why entities are suggested
- Implement user feedback mechanism for suggestions

### 8. Navigation Enhancement
- Implement "breadcrumb" navigation showing exploration path
- Create quick links to recently viewed entities
- Add back/forward navigation between panel states
- Implement panel state persistence during map exploration

### 9. UI Animation and Transitions
- Design smooth opening/closing animations for panels
- Create transitions between different entity views
- Implement loading state animations during data fetching
- Add micro-interactions for better user engagement

### 10. Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for panel sections
- Add component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Create efficient caching strategy for recently viewed entities
- Optimize image loading and processing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```
components/
├── panels/
│   ├── ContextPanel.tsx (main container)
│   ├── EntityDetails.tsx (shared details component)
│   ├── RelationshipList.tsx (connections visualization)
│   ├── ActivityTimeline.tsx (history component)
│   ├── ActionButtons.tsx (entity-specific actions)
│   └── entity-panels/ (specialized implementations)
│       ├── UserPanel.tsx
│       ├── TeamPanel.tsx
│       ├── ProjectPanel.tsx
│       └── GoalPanel.tsx
```

### Data Flow

1. User selects node in `LivingMap.tsx`
2. Node ID and type passed to `ContextPanel.tsx`
3. `ContextPanel` fetches full entity data using API client
4. Based on entity type, appropriate sub-panel renders
5. Relationship data fetched and displayed
6. Activity history loaded (with pagination)
7. Action buttons rendered based on entity type and permissions

### API Requirements

New or enhanced endpoints needed:
- `/api/{entity-type}/{id}/relationships`: Get all relationships for an entity
- `/api/{entity-type}/{id}/activity`: Get paginated activity history
- `/api/{entity-type}/{id}/suggestions`: Get related entity suggestions

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each panel component in isolation
   - Verify proper rendering for each entity type
   - Test error states and loading indicators

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between LivingMap and ContextPanel
   - Verify navigation between related entities
   - Test persistence of panel state during navigation

3. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Verify information clarity and completeness
   - Test navigation flows and relationship exploration
   - Validate action button functionality

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Tasks |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Refactor panel architecture; implement basic common components |
| 2 | Implement entity-specific panel components; enhance relationship visualization |
| 3 | Add rich content support; develop activity timeline component |
| 4 | Implement action buttons; create entity suggestions |
| 5 | Enhance navigation; add animations and transitions |
| 6 | Performance optimization; testing and bug fixes |

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**:
   - Panel opens within 200ms of node selection
   - Smooth animations at 60fps
   - Efficient memory usage for extended sessions

2. **Usability**:
   - Users can access detailed information for all entity types
   - Navigation between related entities is intuitive
   - Panel adapts properly to different screen sizes

3. **Engagement**:
   - Increased time spent exploring the Living Map
   - Higher interaction rate with entity relationships
   - Increased action completion rate from context panels

## Conclusion

The enhanced context panels will significantly improve the user experience of the Living Map by providing detailed, actionable information about organizational entities. This implementation will support the core vision of creating an intuitive, interactive visualization of organizational relationships while maintaining high performance and visual consistency.
