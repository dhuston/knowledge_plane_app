# Implementation Plan for User Story 1.1.9 - Map Insights and Analytics

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the strategy for developing and integrating organizational analytics capabilities into the Living Map. The feature will help users identify patterns, bottlenecks, and opportunities within the organizational structure by leveraging graph theory algorithms and visualization techniques.

## User Story

**As a** user  
**I want** insights and analytics about the organizational structure  
**So that** I can identify patterns, bottlenecks, and opportunities

## Technical Approach
