## Test-Driven Development Plan

For each task, the following TDD approach will be applied:

### 1. Initial Test Writing

For each component or service, write tests that cover:
- Basic functionality with expected inputs/outputs
- Edge cases and error handling
- Integration with other components
- Performance requirements

### 2. Implementation Guidelines

- Write minimal code to pass tests
- Refactor for clarity and maintainability after tests pass
- Follow the project's code style guidelines
- Document public APIs and complex logic

### 3. Testing Levels

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock dependencies as needed
- Focus on pure function behavior

#### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between components
- Verify API contracts are maintained
- Ensure data flows correctly between services

#### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user journeys
- Verify the system works as a whole
- Include visual regression testing for UI

### 4. Test Examples

```typescript
describe('User Preferences API', () => {
  it('should return the current user preferences', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
