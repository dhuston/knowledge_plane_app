# KnowledgePlane AI - Technical Architecture (v0.1)

**Status:** Initial Draft

**Goal:** Outline the high-level technical design and architectural choices for the KnowledgePlane AI platform.

---

## 1. Overall Architecture: Modular Monolith (Initial)

* **Approach:** Start with a **Modular Monolith** architecture, consisting of a single backend API service and the SPA frontend.
* **Rationale:** Prioritizes development speed and reduces operational complexity for the initial stages (MVP/Alpha). A well-defined modular structure within the monolith allows for easier extraction of specific modules into independent microservices later if scaling needs dictate.
* **Modularity:** The backend monolith will be structured internally with clear boundaries between domains (e.g., Users, Integrations, Org Model, Collaboration, AI) to facilitate future separation.
* **Future Evolution:** Based on load, performance bottlenecks, or team structure, specific modules (e.g., `Integration Service`, `AI Service`) may be extracted into separate microservices communicating via RPC (e.g., gRPC) or message queues.

## 2. Deployment Model: Multi-Tenant SaaS

* **Model:** Secure Multi-Tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), hosted in **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**.
* **Rationale:** AWS provides a comprehensive suite of managed services (EKS, RDS, Neptune, SQS, AI/ML services) suitable for building and scaling the platform. Multi-tenancy enables operational efficiency, scalability, faster development cycles, easier updates, and lower cost per customer compared to single-tenant/VPC models, crucial for startup velocity. (See Section 4 for Tenant Isolation details).
* **Future Option:** Premium single-tenant/VPC deployment may be considered post-maturity based on market demand, but the core architecture is multi-tenant first.

## 3. Technology Stack (Initial Choices)

* **Cloud Provider:** **AWS**
* **Backend Language/Framework:** **Python** as the primary language, using **FastAPI**.
  * **Rationale:** FastAPI provides high performance (async), automatic OpenAPI docs, and excellent developer experience. Python's extensive AI/ML ecosystem is critical for the platform's vision. Large talent pool and rapid iteration speed are advantageous for a startup. Specific, performance-critical modules could potentially use Go in the future if needed.
* **Frontend Language/Framework:** **React (using TypeScript)** paired with the **Chakra UI** component library.
  * **Rationale:** Mature ecosystem, component-based architecture, and Chakra UI enables rapid development of a polished, accessible UI.
* **Database(s):** Initial focus on **PostgreSQL** (via AWS RDS).
  * **Rationale:** Robust relational storage for core structured data. Handles initial relationships adequately. Managed service simplifies ops.
  * **Future Evolution:** Dedicated **Graph Database** (e.g., AWS Neptune) planned for `Org Model` queries later.
* **Infrastructure:**
  * **Local Development:** Docker Compose.
  * **Initial Deployment:** Docker containers potentially running on EC2/Fargate or similar simple compute.
  * **Target Architecture:** Kubernetes (likely **AWS EKS**) for orchestration.
  * **IaC:** Terraform.
  * **Portability:** Aim to use S3-compatible storage and avoid excessive AWS-specific service lock-in where feasible.

## 4. Data Model & Persistence

* **Core Concept:** A graph-based model representing entities (Users, Teams, Projects, Goals, Tasks, Notes, Documents, etc.) and their relationships (Reports To, Member Of, Owns, Contributes To, Depends On, etc.). This graph will evolve dynamically.
* **Tenant Isolation Strategy (Multi-Tenant):**
  * **Logical Isolation:** Every API request and data access operation MUST be scoped to the authenticated user's tenant ID.
  * **Database Level:** Likely starting with **Schema-per-Tenant** within a shared **PostgreSQL** database for core relational data. This provides strong logical separation with manageable overhead. Potentially **Database-per-Tenant** for very large clients or specific compliance needs later. Future Graph/Document DBs will have their own multi-tenancy strategies.
  * **Strict enforcement** in data access layers is critical.

## 5. AI/ML Integration Strategy

* **Initial Focus (MVP):** Simple AI/rules for Daily Briefing.
* **Pluggable LLM Interface:** The `AI Service` (initially a module within the monolith) will interact with LLMs through a **well-defined internal interface/adapter**.
  * This allows swapping the backend LLM provider.
  * **Initial Provider:** Likely OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/4) due to capability and ease of use.
  * **Future Options:** Anthropic Claude, local models via Ollama/llama.cpp, fine-tuned models, etc.
* **Pipeline:** Orchestrate data fetching -> LLM interaction (prompting, potentially RAG later) -> Structured output processing -> API response.
* **Future:** More sophisticated models, fine-tuning, RAG using vector databases, potential use of frameworks like LangChain/LlamaIndex.

## 6. Integration Framework

* **Cloud Services (Slack, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, etc.):** Direct API integrations using standard protocols (OAuth2, REST APIs). Managed by the `Integration Service`.
* **Internal/On-Premise Tools:** **Customer-Managed Integration Agent model.**
  * KnowledgePlane AI provides a lightweight agent container/binary.
  * Customer deploys the agent within their network.
  * Agent initiates a secure outbound connection (WebSocket/HTTPS long-polling) to the KnowledgePlane `Integration Service`.
  * `Integration Service` sends requests for internal data (e.g., query internal DB `X`) to the agent via the secure tunnel.
  * Agent executes the request locally and returns the result.
  * Requires clear configuration and security documentation for the customer.
* **Extensibility:** Design the `Integration Service` to be pluggable, allowing new integrations (cloud or agent-based) to be added relatively easily.

## 7. API Design

* **Style:** RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication, potentially gRPC for inter-service communication (performance benefits).
* **Specification:** OpenAPI (Swagger) for REST APIs for clear documentation and contract definition.
* **Authentication/Authorization:** JWT-based authentication, tenant context embedded in tokens or resolved via middleware. Permissions based on user roles and relationship to data within the tenant context.

## 8. Scalability & Performance

* **Horizontal Scaling:** Leverage microservices architecture and Kubernetes for scaling individual services based on load.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS) for background tasks, integration processing, AI analysis to avoid blocking user requests.
* **Caching:** Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis, Memcached) at various levels (API Gateway, service responses, database queries).
* **Database Optimization:** Appropriate indexing, query optimization, potential read replicas.

## 9. Security Considerations

* **Tenant Isolation:** As detailed in Section 4.
* **Authentication:** Robust SSO integration (SAML, OIDC).
* **Authorization:** Enforce permissions rigorously at the API gateway and service level based on tenant context and user roles.
* **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit (TLS everywhere).
* **Secret Management:** Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider KMS).
* **Input Validation:** Protect against injection attacks.
* **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in libraries.
* **Agent Security:** Secure agent communication channel, provide clear guidance on agent permissions within the customer network.
* **Regular Audits & Penetration Testing.**

## 10. Monitoring & Logging

* **Centralized Logging:** Aggregate logs from all services (e.g., ELK stack, Datadog, CloudWatch Logs).
* **Distributed Tracing:** Implement tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to track requests across microservices.
* **Metrics & Monitoring:** Collect key performance indicators (latency, error rates, resource utilization) for services and infrastructure (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, CloudWatch Metrics).
* **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical errors or performance degradation.
