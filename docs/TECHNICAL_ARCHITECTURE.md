# KnowledgePlane AI - Technical Architecture (v0.1)

**Status:** Initial Draft

**Goal:** Outline the high-level technical design and architectural choices for the KnowledgePlane AI platform.

---

## 1. Overall Architecture: Microservices

*   **Approach:** A distributed system based on microservices.
*   **Rationale:** Supports independent scaling of components, technology diversity (if needed), clear separation of concerns, fault isolation, and enables smaller, focused development teams as the platform grows. Addresses the complexity inherent in the platform's goals (AI, integrations, collaboration, org modeling).
*   **Initial Service Boundaries (Examples - TBD):**
    *   `User Service`: Manages user profiles, authentication concerns.
    *   `Workspace Service`: Handles individual workspace state, configuration.
    *   `Integration Service`: Manages connections and data flow from external tools (both cloud and via agents).
    *   `Org Model Service`: Stores and manages the emergent organizational graph data.
    *   `Collaboration Service`: Manages Project Hubs, discussions, etc.
    *   `AI Service / Briefing Service`: Orchestrates data gathering and generation of AI insights like the Daily Briefing.
    *   `API Gateway`: Single entry point for frontend requests, routing to backend services.

## 2. Deployment Model: Multi-Tenant SaaS

*   **Model:** Secure Multi-Tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), hosted in **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**.
*   **Rationale:** AWS provides a comprehensive suite of managed services (EKS, RDS, Neptune, SQS, AI/ML services) suitable for building and scaling the platform. Multi-tenancy enables operational efficiency, scalability, faster development cycles, easier updates, and lower cost per customer compared to single-tenant/VPC models, crucial for startup velocity. (See Section 4 for Tenant Isolation details).
*   **Future Option:** Premium single-tenant/VPC deployment may be considered post-maturity based on market demand, but the core architecture is multi-tenant first.

## 3. Technology Stack (Initial Choices)

*   **Cloud Provider:** **AWS**
*   **Backend Language/Framework:** **Python** as the primary language. Specific framework (e.g., **FastAPI**, Django) TBD based on final evaluation.
    *   **Rationale:** Large talent pool, excellent ecosystem for AI/ML (critical for long-term vision), mature web frameworks, suitable for rapid development. Performance is generally sufficient for web services, and async frameworks mitigate I/O bottlenecks. Allows for introducing other languages (like Go) for specific performance-critical microservices later if needed.
*   **Frontend Language/Framework:** **React (using TypeScript)** paired with the **Chakra UI** component library.
    *   **Rationale:** Leverages React's mature ecosystem. Chakra UI provides excellent developer experience, accessibility, composability, and theming, enabling rapid development of a polished UI suitable for the Vision Demo (Slice 0) and beyond.
*   **Database(s):** Initial focus on **PostgreSQL** (via AWS RDS).
    *   **Rationale:** Mature, robust, ACID-compliant relational database suitable for core structured data (users, tenants, collaboration hubs, etc.). Capable of storing the *initial* simple organizational relationships (manager links, team memberships) needed for MVP Slice 1. Managed service (RDS) simplifies operations.
    *   **Future Evolution:** A dedicated **Graph Database** (e.g., AWS Neptune, Neo4j) is planned for the `Org Model Service` in a later slice (post-Slice 1) to handle complex organizational queries and relationship analysis efficiently.
    *   *Other DBs (Document/Key-Value) may be introduced for specific service needs later.*
*   **Infrastructure:** Containerization (Docker), Orchestration (Kubernetes - likely **AWS EKS**), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).

## 4. Data Model & Persistence

*   **Core Concept:** A graph-based model representing entities (Users, Teams, Projects, Goals, Tasks, Notes, Documents, etc.) and their relationships (Reports To, Member Of, Owns, Contributes To, Depends On, etc.). This graph will evolve dynamically.
*   **Tenant Isolation Strategy (Multi-Tenant):**
    *   **Logical Isolation:** Every API request and data access operation MUST be scoped to the authenticated user's tenant ID.
    *   **Database Level:** Likely starting with **Schema-per-Tenant** within a shared **PostgreSQL** database for core relational data. This provides strong logical separation with manageable overhead. Potentially **Database-per-Tenant** for very large clients or specific compliance needs later. Future Graph/Document DBs will have their own multi-tenancy strategies.
    *   **Strict enforcement** in data access layers is critical.

## 5. AI/ML Integration Strategy

*   **Initial Focus (MVP):** Relatively simple AI - rule-based systems or basic statistical models for the Daily Briefing (e.g., pulling calendar events, identifying mentions in collaboration hubs).
*   **Pipeline:** Dedicated `AI Service` will likely orchestrate:
    1.  Fetching relevant data from other services (Workspace, Calendar Integration, Org Model, Collaboration) via internal APIs.
    2.  Applying rules/models to generate insights/summaries.
    3.  Providing results via API (e.g., to the Workspace Service for display).
*   **Future:** Explore more sophisticated ML models (NLP for understanding discussion content, graph embeddings for relationship analysis, predictive models for risk detection) as data accumulates and use cases mature. Leverage cloud provider AI services where applicable.

## 6. Integration Framework

*   **Cloud Services (Slack, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, etc.):** Direct API integrations using standard protocols (OAuth2, REST APIs). Managed by the `Integration Service`.
*   **Internal/On-Premise Tools:** **Customer-Managed Integration Agent model.**
    *   KnowledgePlane AI provides a lightweight agent container/binary.
    *   Customer deploys the agent within their network.
    *   Agent initiates a secure outbound connection (WebSocket/HTTPS long-polling) to the KnowledgePlane `Integration Service`.
    *   `Integration Service` sends requests for internal data (e.g., query internal DB `X`) to the agent via the secure tunnel.
    *   Agent executes the request locally and returns the result.
    *   Requires clear configuration and security documentation for the customer.
*   **Extensibility:** Design the `Integration Service` to be pluggable, allowing new integrations (cloud or agent-based) to be added relatively easily.

## 7. API Design

*   **Style:** RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication, potentially gRPC for inter-service communication (performance benefits).
*   **Specification:** OpenAPI (Swagger) for REST APIs for clear documentation and contract definition.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** JWT-based authentication, tenant context embedded in tokens or resolved via middleware. Permissions based on user roles and relationship to data within the tenant context.

## 8. Scalability & Performance

*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Leverage microservices architecture and Kubernetes for scaling individual services based on load.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS) for background tasks, integration processing, AI analysis to avoid blocking user requests.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis, Memcached) at various levels (API Gateway, service responses, database queries).
*   **Database Optimization:** Appropriate indexing, query optimization, potential read replicas.

## 9. Security Considerations

*   **Tenant Isolation:** As detailed in Section 4.
*   **Authentication:** Robust SSO integration (SAML, OIDC).
*   **Authorization:** Enforce permissions rigorously at the API gateway and service level based on tenant context and user roles.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit (TLS everywhere).
*   **Secret Management:** Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider KMS).
*   **Input Validation:** Protect against injection attacks.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in libraries.
*   **Agent Security:** Secure agent communication channel, provide clear guidance on agent permissions within the customer network.
*   **Regular Audits & Penetration Testing.**

## 10. Monitoring & Logging

*   **Centralized Logging:** Aggregate logs from all services (e.g., ELK stack, Datadog, CloudWatch Logs).
*   **Distributed Tracing:** Implement tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to track requests across microservices.
*   **Metrics & Monitoring:** Collect key performance indicators (latency, error rates, resource utilization) for services and infrastructure (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, CloudWatch Metrics).
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical errors or performance degradation.
