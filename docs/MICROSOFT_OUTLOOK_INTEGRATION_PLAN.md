# Microsoft Outlook Integration for Daily Briefing

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Microsoft Outlook calendar events into the daily briefing panel of the Biosphere application. The integration will allow users to see their upcoming meetings and related information in their daily briefing.

## Current State Analysis

Based on the codebase review, we already have:

1. **Microsoft Outlook Connector (`microsoft_outlook.py`)**: A connector implementation that can fetch calendar events, emails, and contacts from Microsoft Graph API.
2. **Calendar Event Processor (`calendar_processor.py`)**: A processor that handles calendar events and creates knowledge graph nodes.
3. **Daily Briefing Component (`DailyBriefing.tsx`)**: A frontend component that displays calendar events and meeting preparations.
4. **Briefing Service (`briefing_service.py`)**: A backend service that generates daily briefings, currently integrated with Google Calendar only.

## Missing Components

To complete the Microsoft Outlook integration for daily briefings, we need to implement:

1. **Calendar Service with Microsoft Outlook Support**: A service similar to the Google Calendar service but for Microsoft Outlook.
2. **Calendar Events API Endpoint**: An endpoint to fetch calendar events directly for the frontend.
3. **Enhanced Briefing Service**: Update to support multiple calendar sources.
4. **Real Data Calendar Hook**: Update the frontend hook to fetch real data from the backend.

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case
- User wants to see their upcoming calendar events from Microsoft Outlook in their daily briefing.

### Secondary Use Cases
- User wants to see meeting preparations for upcoming meetings.
- User wants to see relevant documents and information related to their meetings.
- User wants to see attendee information for upcoming meetings.

## Constraints and Dependencies

1. **Authentication**: The integration depends on OAuth authentication with Microsoft Graph API.
2. **Permission Scopes**: Requires calendar read permissions from the user.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Need to handle Microsoft Graph API rate limits.
4. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Integration must respect tenant boundaries.

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Backend Implementation**
   - Create Microsoft Outlook calendar service
   - Update briefing service to support multiple calendar sources
   - Create calendar events API endpoint
   - Implement comprehensive testing

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Update useCalendarEvents hook to fetch real data
   - Enhance DailyBriefing component for Microsoft Teams meeting information
   - Add loading state handling for calendar data
   - Implement frontend tests

## Success Criteria

1. Users can see their Microsoft Outlook calendar events in the daily briefing.
2. Meeting details are correctly displayed, including time, location, and attendees.
3. Online meeting links (Microsoft Teams) are properly extracted and displayed.
4. Performance is optimized with appropriate caching and lazy loading.
5. All code is thoroughly tested with unit and integration tests.
