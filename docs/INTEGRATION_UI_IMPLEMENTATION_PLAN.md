# Integration Configuration UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the integration configuration UI in the admin panel. The goal is to create a more user-friendly, robust interface for administrators to discover, configure, test, monitor, and manage external system integrations.

## Current State Analysis

After analyzing the existing integration UI components:

1. We have a basic `EnhancedIntegrationsPanel` component in the admin panel
2. The current UI allows basic CRUD operations for integrations
3. There's a modal for adding new integrations and viewing/editing details
4. The backend has models for `Integration`, `IntegrationCredential`, and `IntegrationRun`
5. The `BaseConnector` class defines the interface for integration connectors

## Use Cases and Requirements

### Primary Use Cases

## Test-Driven Development Approach

For each component in this implementation plan, we'll follow these TDD steps:

1. **Write Test Specifications**
   - Define component props and behavior
   - Create test cases for all states (normal, loading, error)
   - Define accessibility requirements
   - Specify performance expectations

2. **Create Test Suite**
   - Set up testing environment with mocks
   - Implement tests for all specifications
   - Ensure test coverage for edge cases
   - Add accessibility tests

3. **Implement Component**
   - Build minimal implementation to pass tests
   - Refactor for readability and performance
   - Add documentation and examples

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test component in context with related components
   - Verify state management
   - Check for performance issues
