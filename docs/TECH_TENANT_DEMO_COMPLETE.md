# Tech Innovations Inc. Demo Tenant - Complete Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the completed setup of the Tech Innovations Inc. demo tenant with a realistic organizational structure. The setup includes departments, teams, projects, and their relationships in both the database and the graph visualization.

## Database Migration Cleanup

The migration system was causing issues due to conflicting migration histories. To resolve this, we:

1. Created a comprehensive backup of the database
2. Archived all the old migration files
3. Established a clean baseline migration representing the current schema
4. Manually set the alembic_version table to point to this baseline
5. Created documentation about the process in `MIGRATION_CLEANUP.md`

## Tech Innovations Inc. Demo Data

## Next Steps

To further enhance the Tech Innovations Inc. demo tenant:

1. Add users to teams with appropriate roles
2. Add goals aligned with projects
3. Add knowledge assets related to projects
4. Create more complex relationships between entities
5. Add detailed profiles for key users

## Technical Notes

- All entities are properly stored in their respective tables in the database
- All entities have corresponding nodes in the graph database
- Proper relationships are established between entities via edges
- The database migration system has been cleaned up for smoother future development
