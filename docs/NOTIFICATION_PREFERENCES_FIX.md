# Notification Preferences System Fix

## Issue Description

The notification system was experiencing an error when trying to access the user's notification preferences:

```
Error in get_all_for_user_async: (sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.asyncpg.ProgrammingError) <class 'asyncpg.exceptions.UndefinedTableError'>: relation "notification_preferences" does not exist
```

This was causing the frontend to display an error message: 
```
[Debug] Notification preferences response is missing expected data structure: undefined
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The `NotificationPreference` model was correctly defined in `app/models/notification.py` with the table name `notification_preferences`
2. However, the initial database schema migration (`0001_baseline_schema.py`) did not include this table
3. No subsequent migration was created to add this table to the database
4. The frontend expected a properly structured response with notification preferences, but the backend couldn't retrieve any because the table didn't exist

## Solution

### 1. Database Migration

Created a new migration file `0002_add_notification_preferences.py` that:
- Creates the `notification_preferences` table with the proper schema
- Adds the necessary foreign key constraints to link to the `users` table
- Creates an index on `user_id` for better query performance

### 2. Frontend Error Handling 

Enhanced the frontend's error handling to provide default preferences when the API returns an error:
- Added more robust null/undefined checks
- Created a set of default preferences that match what the backend would normally create
- Improved error logging for easier debugging

### 3. Backend Error Handling

Improved the backend's error handling for notification preferences:
- Added in-memory default preferences when database operations fail
- Enhanced logging to provide more context when errors occur
- Made sure the response structure is always valid, even in error cases

## Implementation Details

1. Migration SQL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_preferences (
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    notification_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    email_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, notification_type),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);
CREATE INDEX ix_notification_preferences_user_id ON notification_preferences (user_id);
```

2. Default notification types and settings:
```
activity: in-app only (no email)
insight: in-app and email
reminder: in-app and email
system: in-app only (no email)
mention: in-app and email
relationship: in-app only (no email)
```

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Apply the database migration:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Restart the backend service:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart backend
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache and cookies** to ensure the frontend gets fresh data

## Verification

After applying the fix:
1. The backend logs should no longer show the "relation does not exist" error
2. The frontend should successfully load user preferences or use default values
3. Users should be able to modify their notification preferences via the UI

## Prevention Measures

1. Always include database schema changes in migration files
2. Test new models with actual database operations before deployment
3. Add more comprehensive testing for notification-related functionality
4. Implement better frontend error handling for all API calls
