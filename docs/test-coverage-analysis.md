# Test Coverage Analysis

## Current State

Based on the repository scan, we've analyzed the test coverage for both frontend and backend components. This document outlines the current state and identifies key areas for improvement to reach 80%+ coverage.

## Frontend Test Coverage

### Overview
- Total Components: 120+ React components
- Components with Tests: ~32 components
- Estimated Current Coverage: ~25-30%

### Key Components with Tests
- Admin components (AdminConsole, AdminLayout, etc.)
- Map visualization components (LivingMap, MapControls, etc.)
- Context panels (ContextPanel, ContextDrawer)
- Hierarchy components (HierarchyNavigator)
- Notifications (NotificationCenter, NotificationMapFilter)
- Workspace components (WorkspaceDashboard, DailyBriefing)

### Critical Components Missing Tests
1. **Core UI Components**
   - Most UI components in `/components/ui/`
   - Many common components in `/components/common/`
   - Form components in `/components/forms/`

2. **Entity-specific Components**
   - Entity panels (UserPanel, TeamPanel, ProjectPanel, GoalPanel)
   - Node-specific components (UserNode, TeamNode, etc.)

3. **Integration Components**
   - IntegrationsPanel, IntegrationCard, IntegrationModal

4. **Context & State Management**
   - Most context providers except AdminContext

## Backend Test Coverage

### Overview
- Core Services: ~20 service modules
- API Endpoints: 15+ routers with multiple endpoints each
- Current Test Coverage: ~15-20% (estimated)

### Key Services with Tests
- Briefing Service
- Microsoft Outlook Service
- Notification Service
- Base connectors and integration related services

### Critical Components Missing Tests
1. **API Endpoints**
   - Users API
   - Teams API
   - Projects API
   - Map API (partial coverage)
   - Graph API

2. **Core Services**
   - Entity Recognition Service
   - LLM Service
   - Clustering Engine
   - Most data access services (CRUD)

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Some authentication flows
   - Permission validation

## Recommended Priority Areas

### Frontend
1. Context Panel Components - central to application functionality
2. Map visualization components - core feature of the platform
3. Workspace dashboard components - frequent user interaction
4. Common UI components - used throughout the application

### Backend
1. Map & Graph APIs - core data providers
2. User/Team/Project CRUD operations - foundational data access
3. Integration framework components - system integrations
4. Authentication flows - security critical

## Test Implementation Plan

To reach 80%+ coverage, we should prioritize:

### Phase 1: Foundational Components
- Entity panels (UserPanel, TeamPanel, ProjectPanel, GoalPanel)
- Common UI components (Badge, Card, etc.)
- Map API endpoints
- Core CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Integration Components
- Service interactions
- Data flow between components
- Entity relationships

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Notification system
- Collaborative features
- Activity tracking

## Testing Approach

1. **Component Tests**: Focus on rendering, props, and state management
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and API communication
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user flows

## Coverage Targets

| Area | Current (est.) | Target |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Frontend Components | 25-30% | 80% |
| UI Components | 10-15% | 75% |
| Backend Services | 20-25% | 85% |
| API Endpoints | 15-20% | 80% |
| Core User Flows | 10% | 90% |
