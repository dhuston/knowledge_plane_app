## MVP Phasing & Demo Strategy

To balance the need for rapid demonstration (for VCs, early customers) with building a robust platform, the MVP rollout is planned in slices:

### Slice 0: The Vision Demo (Target: Weeks)

* **Goal:** Create a visually compelling frontend prototype demonstrating the *essence* of KnowledgePlane AI's value proposition. Prioritize speed and impact over fully functional backend systems.
* **Target Audience:** VCs, potential early pilot customers.
* **Technology Focus:** Frontend-heavy (React/Vue + TypeScript), high-fidelity UI/UX, minimal/mock backend (hardcoded data or simple mock server).

* **Key User Stories Represented & Simulation Strategy:**
    ...

### Slice 0.5: Vision Demo - Organizational Context (Target: + ~1-2 Weeks)

**Goal:** Enhance the Slice 0 demo with mocked UI views that illustrate organizational context, alignment (Goals/OKRs), and multi-level value, using static data.

**Epics Involved (Conceptual):** Emergent Organizational Model, Strategic Alignment Engine.

**Tasks:**
    ...

### Slice 1: The Technical Validation Alpha (Target: + ~1-2 Months after Slice 0.5)

* **Goal:** Replace core mocks with real backend plumbing for key pathways. Validate core technical assumptions for authentication, database persistence, basic API communication, and the first integration. Demonstrate the *start* of the Emergent Org Model with real data.
* **Target Audience:** Internal team, potentially trusted advisors/friends & family.
* **Technology Focus:** Initial Python/FastAPI backend (Modular Monolith), PostgreSQL DB setup w/ Alembic, Docker Compose for local dev, Real SSO (Google), Real Calendar API integration (Google), JWT Auth, Basic API endpoint, Frontend integration.
* **Key Features / User Stories:**
  * Backend: Setup FastAPI project, initial User/Tenant models & migrations (Alembic), DB connection.
  * Authentication: Implement Google OAuth2 login flow (backend callback, user upsert, JWT generation/validation).
  * API: Create `/users/me` endpoint returning authenticated user data from DB.
  * Frontend: Connect Login page to backend OAuth flow, handle JWT, fetch and display real user data on Profile/Nav.
  * Integration: Implement Google Calendar API auth (OAuth) and fetch today's events (backend).
  * AI Briefing: Replace static briefing calendar items with dynamically fetched Google Calendar data.
  * Org Model (Seed): During user sync/auth, attempt to pull manager info from Google API and store `manager_id` link in User table. Display linked manager name on Profile page.

### Slice 2: The Pilot MVP (Target: + ~2-3 Months after Slice 1)

* **Goal:** Deliver the full MVP scope as defined in the Epics below, ready for carefully selected pilot customers.
* **Target Audience:** Initial pilot customers.
* **Technology Focus:** Complete MVP features, robust integration handling, basic monitoring/logging, initial deployment pipeline.

## Epics & User Stories

### Epic: Core Platform & User Onboarding (MVP Foundation)

* **Goal:** Establish the basic platform infrastructure, user authentication, and the initial **intelligent workspace shell designed to integrate and overlay information**.
* **User Stories (MVP Focus):**
  * As a new user, I want to sign up for KnowledgePlane using my company's Google Workspace account so that I don't need to create a separate password.
  * As a new user, I want to sign up for KnowledgePlane using my company's Microsoft Azure AD account so that I don't need to create a separate password.
  * As a new user, I want to log in securely using my integrated company account (Google/Microsoft).
  * As a user, I want to see my basic profile information (name, email, title - if available) automatically populated from my company directory upon first login.
  * As a user, I want a basic, persistent workspace view **that displays my AI Daily Briefing and provides access to collaboration hubs and integrated information**.
  * As a platform administrator, I want basic tenant isolation configured so that data from different customer organizations is kept separate.

### Epic: Individual AI Workspace - Intelligent Overlay & Collaboration (MVP)

* **Goal:** Provide immediate value via an **AI assistant that summarizes the user's day, acting as an intelligent layer above their tools, and offer a basic native collaboration hub**.
* **User Stories (MVP Focus):**
  * **[AI Assistant]** As a user, when I start my day, I want to see an **AI-generated Daily Briefing** in my workspace summarizing key information (e.g., upcoming meetings from calendar, mentions, key project updates - *initial version may be simple*).
  * **[AI Assistant]** As the system (AI), I want to generate the Daily Briefing by pulling data from integrated sources (initially Calendar, basic profile info).
  * **[AI Assistant]** As a user, I want the Daily Briefing presented in clear prose, potentially highlighting key entities (people, projects, meetings).
  * **[Collaboration Hub]** As a user, I want to create a basic **Project Collaboration Hub** (e.g., a simple page/space associated with a project name).
  * **[Collaboration Hub]** As a user, I want to add simple notes or updates within a Project Collaboration Hub.
  * **[Collaboration Hub]** As a user, I want to invite/add other KnowledgePlane users to a Project Collaboration Hub.
  * **[Intelligent Overlay]** As a user, I want my workspace to indicate placeholders or connection points for future integration with common business tools (e.g., Project Management, CRM - *visual cue only for MVP*).
  * *(Dependency: Requires Calendar Integration)*
  * *(Dependency: Requires basic User Profile data)*

### Epic: Integration - Identity & Basic Structure (MVP)

* **Goal:** Integrate with core identity providers to enable SSO and **passively infer and display basic organizational structure**.
* **User Stories (MVP Focus):**
  * As the system, I want to periodically sync basic user profile data (name, email, title, manager - if available) from the configured Identity Provider (Google/Microsoft) to keep user information up-to-date.
  * As the system, I want to infer basic reporting relationships ("reports to") based on manager information synced from the Identity Provider.
  * As the system, I want to identify basic team/group memberships based on group data synced from the Identity Provider (e.g., Azure AD groups, Google Groups).
  * **As a user, I want to see my inferred manager and team memberships (if available from sync) displayed on my user profile page.**

### Epic: Integration - Calendar (MVP)

* **Goal:** Integrate with user calendars to understand schedules and inform the AI Daily Briefing.
* **User Stories (MVP Focus):**
  * As a user, I want to authenticate my Google Calendar with KnowledgePlane so the platform can read my schedule (read-only).
  * As a user, I want to authenticate my Microsoft Outlook Calendar (via Microsoft Graph) with KnowledgePlane so the platform can read my schedule (read-only).
  * As the system, I want to fetch calendar events (today/near future) for authenticated users to use as input for the AI Daily Briefing.

### Epic: Integration - Communication (MVP Scaffolding)

* **Goal:** Integrate with a core communication tool to **establish the connection and enable future pattern analysis**. (Note: MVP functionality limited to auth and basic data pull).
* **User Stories (MVP Focus):**
  * As a user, I want to authenticate my company's Slack account with KnowledgePlane so the platform can access relevant public channel information (read-only initially).
  * As a user, I want to authenticate my company's Microsoft Teams account with KnowledgePlane so the platform can access relevant public channel/team information (read-only initially).
  * *(Post-MVP Story Example): As the system, I want to identify channels/teams a user is part of based on the communication integration.*
  * *(Post-MVP Story Example): As a user, I want to see recent messages from connected channels relevant to a specific project I'm viewing within KnowledgePlane.*

### Epic: Integration - Document Storage (MVP Scaffolding)
