# KnowledgePlane AI - Comprehensive Product Backlog

**Note:** This is a living document that provides a roadmap for development. Items will be refined, detailed, and prioritized continuously based on the Agile development process.

---

## Core Vision Elements

1. **Living Map** - Interactive visualization of organizational relationships
2. **AI-Powered Workspace** - Personalized, intelligent assistant for each user
3. **Insights & Alerts** - Contextual intelligence surfaced proactively

## MVP Phasing & Demo Strategy

To balance the need for rapid demonstration (for VCs, early customers) with building a robust platform centered on the Living Map, the MVP rollout is planned in slices:

### Slice 0: The Vision Demo (Target: Weeks)

* **Goal:** Create a visually compelling frontend prototype demonstrating the *essence* of the **Living Map** and KnowledgePlane AI's value proposition. Prioritize speed and impact over fully functional backend systems.
* **Target Audience:** VCs, potential early pilot customers.
* **Technology Focus:** Frontend-heavy (React/TypeScript, potentially a basic graph viz lib like react-flow), high-fidelity UI/UX, minimal/mock backend (hardcoded data or simple mock server).
* **Key User Stories Represented & Simulation Strategy:** Mock a simple version of the Living Map showing a few nodes (people, teams, projects) and links. Implement basic hover effects showing mock context panels. Simulate navigation/interaction with the map. Include mockups of the Daily Briefing panel and Insights feed, drawing attention to how they relate to the map.

### Slice 0.5: Vision Demo - Organizational Context (Target: + ~1-2 Weeks)

**Goal:** Enhance the Slice 0 demo by enriching the **mocked Living Map** with more nodes representing organizational context (Goals/OKRs, Departments) and illustrating alignment (e.g., linking projects to goals visually on the map). Use static data.

**Epics Involved (Conceptual):** Living Map Visualization, Emergent Organizational Model, Strategic Alignment Engine.

**Tasks:** Add mock goal nodes, department nodes to the map visualization. Show visual links representing alignment. Add mock Goal/Department pages accessible perhaps via clicking nodes on the map.

### Slice 1: The Technical Validation Alpha (Target: + ~1-2 Months after Slice 0.5)

* **Goal:** Replace core mocks with real backend plumbing for key pathways. Validate core technical assumptions for authentication, database persistence, basic API communication, and the first integration. Demonstrate the *start* of the Emergent Org Model with real data **feeding a very basic, technically functional Living Map view**. Focus is on backend plumbing and data flow, less on visual polish of the map itself at this stage.
* **Target Audience:** Internal team, potentially trusted advisors/friends & family.
* **Technology Focus:** Initial Python/FastAPI backend (Modular Monolith), PostgreSQL DB setup w/ Alembic, Docker Compose for local dev, Real SSO (Google), Real Calendar API integration (Google), JWT Auth, Basic API endpoints for map data, Simple frontend graph rendering.
* **Key Features / User Stories:**
  * Backend: Setup FastAPI project, initial User/Tenant/Team models & migrations (Alembic), DB connection. Define basic Node/Edge concepts for the map data.
  * Authentication: Implement Google OAuth2 login flow (backend callback, user upsert, JWT generation/validation).
  * API: Create `/users/me`, `/users/{id}`, `/teams/{id}` endpoints returning authenticated user data from DB. Create initial `/map/data` endpoint returning basic node/link data for the current user's context.
  * Frontend: Connect Login page to backend OAuth flow, handle JWT, fetch and display real user data on Profile/Nav. **Implement a rudimentary graph view component that consumes `/map/data` and renders nodes (users, teams) and basic links (manager, team membership).**
  * Integration: Implement Google Calendar API auth (OAuth) and fetch today's events (backend). Store credentials.
  * AI Briefing (Map Context): Replace static briefing calendar items with dynamically fetched Google Calendar data, presented in a panel potentially linked to the user's node on the map.
  * Org Model (Seed): During user sync/auth, attempt to pull manager info from Google API and store `manager_id` link in User table. **Visualize this 'reports-to' link on the rudimentary map.** Display linked manager name on Profile page/panel.

### Slice 2: The Pilot MVP (Target: + ~2-3 Months after Slice 1)

* **Goal:** Deliver the full MVP scope as defined in the Epics below, featuring a **functional and interactive Living Map** as the core UX, ready for carefully selected pilot customers.
* **Target Audience:** Initial pilot customers.
* **Technology Focus:** Complete MVP features, robust integration handling, enhanced map visualization (**initial visual polish**, interactivity, basic filtering, contextual panels), initial AI insights surfaced, basic monitoring/logging, initial deployment pipeline.
