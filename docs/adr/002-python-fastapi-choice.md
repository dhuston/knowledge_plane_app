# ADR-002: Backend Language and Framework Choice

**Date:** 4/13/25

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We need to select a primary backend language and web framework for the initial implementation of KnowledgePlane AI (Modular Monolith). Key considerations include development speed, performance, scalability, ecosystem support (especially for AI/ML), talent availability, and future maintainability.

Candidates considered: Python (with FastAPI, Django), Node.js (TypeScript), Go.

## Decision

We will use **Python** as the primary backend language, with **FastAPI** as the web framework.

## Consequences

**Pros:**

* **Rich AI/ML Ecosystem:** Python provides unparalleled access to libraries and frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace, spaCy, PyTorch/TensorFlow, etc.) crucial for KnowledgePlane's core AI features and future development.
* **Rapid Development:** Python's concise syntax and mature frameworks enable fast iteration, important for a startup.
* **Large Talent Pool:** Easier to find and hire developers familiar with Python.
* **FastAPI Performance:** FastAPI leverages Python's async capabilities (asyncio) and type hints for performance competitive with Node.js and approaching Go for I/O-bound tasks typical of web APIs.
* **Automatic Docs:** FastAPI provides automatic generation of interactive OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.
* **Type Safety:** Using Python type hints with FastAPI enhances code quality and maintainability.

**Cons:**

* **Raw Performance:** For purely CPU-bound tasks, Go generally offers better raw performance than Python (though less relevant for typical API workloads).
* **Concurrency Model:** While asyncio is powerful, Go's goroutines are often considered simpler for managing high concurrency (mitigated by FastAPI's design).

**Future Considerations:**
The modular monolith architecture allows for potentially rewriting specific, performance-critical, self-contained modules in Go later if significant, measurable bottlenecks are identified in Python.
