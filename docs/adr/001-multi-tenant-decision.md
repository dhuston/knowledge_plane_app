# ADR-001: Multi-Tenant SaaS Deployment Model

**Date:** [Current Date]

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

KnowledgePlane AI needs a deployment model that supports scalability, operational efficiency, and rapid iteration suitable for a startup, while ensuring strong data isolation and security for enterprise customers. Key considerations include data sensitivity, integration with internal customer tools, operational overhead, cost, and time-to-market.

## Decision

We will adopt a **secure, multi-tenant SaaS architecture** hosted on AWS as the primary deployment model.

Key aspects:
*   **Isolation:** Implement robust tenant isolation at multiple layers (application logic, database - likely schema-per-tenant initially in PostgreSQL).
*   **Security:** Adhere to best practices (encryption, IAM, network security, dependency scanning, etc.).
*   **Internal Integration:** Utilize a **Customer-Managed Integration Agent** model for secure connectivity to internal customer tools without requiring inbound firewall rules for the customer.
*   **Scalability:** Leverage cloud-native services (e.g., AWS EKS, RDS) and microservices for horizontal scaling.

## Consequences

**Pros:**
*   Lower operational overhead compared to managing individual VPCs per customer.
*   Faster deployment cycles and easier platform updates.
*   Better economies of scale, potentially lower cost per customer.
*   Standardized infrastructure simplifies monitoring and maintenance.
*   Supports faster onboarding and potentially broader market reach initially.

**Cons:**
*   Requires meticulous design and implementation of tenant isolation mechanisms.
*   Some large enterprise customers may initially express preference for single-tenant/VPC despite robust multi-tenant security (can be addressed with clear communication and potentially a future premium tier).
*   Shared infrastructure requires careful resource monitoring and management to prevent noisy neighbor issues (mitigated by microservices and cloud scaling).

**Future Considerations:**
A premium single-tenant or VPC deployment option can be explored later if strong market demand justifies the increased operational complexity and cost.
