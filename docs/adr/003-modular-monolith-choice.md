# ADR-003: Initial Architecture - Modular Monolith

**Date:** 4/13/25

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We need an initial backend architecture for KnowledgePlane AI that balances development speed, operational simplicity, and future scalability. The platform has broad scope involving user management, integrations, complex data relationships (org model), collaboration, and AI features.

Options considered: Microservices from Day 1, Modular Monolith.

## Decision

We will start with a **Modular Monolith** architecture for the backend API.

This involves a single deployable API service (likely built with Python/FastAPI) structured internally with clear logical boundaries between different functional domains (e.g., Users, Integrations, Collaboration, AI).

## Consequences

**Pros:**

* **Faster Initial Development:** Reduced complexity compared to setting up inter-service communication, distributed transactions, separate deployment pipelines, and infrastructure for multiple services from the start.
* **Simplified Operations:** Easier to deploy, monitor, and manage a single service initially.
* **Simplified Local Development:** Easier for developers to run the entire backend stack locally.
* **Easier Refactoring (within monolith):** Refactoring across module boundaries is simpler within a single codebase compared to coordinating changes across microservices.

**Cons:**

* **Scalability Limits (Long Term):** A single monolith cannot scale specific components independently. If one part becomes a major bottleneck, scaling the entire service might be inefficient.
* **Technology Constraints:** Less flexibility to use different languages or frameworks for different parts of the system compared to microservices.
* **Deployment Coupling:** All modules are deployed together; a change in one module requires redeploying the entire application.
* **Risk of Tight Coupling:** Requires discipline to maintain clear boundaries between modules; can degrade into a "distributed big ball of mud" if not managed carefully.

**Mitigation & Future Considerations:**

* **Strong Modularity:** Emphasize clear interfaces and minimal dependencies between internal modules from the beginning.
* **Future Extraction:** Design modules with future extraction into independent microservices in mind. This becomes feasible if specific modules require independent scaling, different technologies, or separate team ownership.
