# Epic 5.1: Organizational Hierarchy Navigator

## Overview

The Organizational Hierarchy Navigator adds a complementary view to our product that displays the formal organizational structure alongside our existing emergent collaboration views. This feature recognizes the duality in how organizations function: through both rigid hierarchical structures (org charts) and dynamic emergent networks (our Living Map).

Located in the "My Work" area as a collapsible sidebar, the hierarchy navigator allows users to understand their place within the formal organization while working on their daily tasks. Users can navigate up their reporting chain (team → department → organization) with chevron-style navigation elements.

## Business Value

- Provides dual perspective on organizational structure and function
- Contextualizes user's work within the formal organizational hierarchy
- Helps new employees understand reporting structures and find key contacts
- Enables managers to explain team function within broader organizational context
- Bridges the gap between how organizations are formally structured and how work actually happens
- Reduces time spent searching for organizational context and contacts

## User Stories

1. **Hierarchical Context**  
   As a user, I want to see my position in the organizational hierarchy via a sidebar in my workspace to understand how my work relates to the formal structure.

2. **Upward Navigation**  
   As a team member, I want to navigate up my reporting chain to explore my department and organization structure without leaving my workspace.

3. **Team Information**  
   As a colleague, I want to quickly view team information (members, manager, goals) to find collaborators and understand their priorities.

4. **Department Overview**  
   As a team lead, I want to see how my team fits within our department to explain our function to stakeholders and new team members.

5. **Organizational Discovery**  
   As a new employee, I want to explore the organizational structure to understand reporting lines and identify key contacts.

6. **Context Filtering**  
   As a project manager, I want to filter and view my work by organizational unit to prioritize by departmental alignment.

7. **Visual Consistency**  
   As a user, I want the hierarchy navigation to use consistent visual language with the Living Map to understand the relationship between formal and emergent structures.

8. **Mobile Access**  
   As a mobile user, I want to access the organizational hierarchy on smaller screens with appropriate touch interactions.
