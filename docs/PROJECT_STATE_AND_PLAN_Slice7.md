# KnowledgePlane AI - Project State & Slice 7 Plan

**Date:** 2024-07-29 (Generated based on review)

## 1. Introduction

This document captures a snapshot of the KnowledgePlane AI project after the completion of foundational work up to Slice 6. It includes an assessment of progress, an evaluation of the current architecture, and outlines the plan and rationale for Slice 7, which focuses on validating the core AI-driven value proposition.

## 2. Progress Summary (Slices 0-6)

Significant progress has been made in establishing the core platform and the central "Living Map" user experience:

*   **Vision Demo (Slices 0, 0.5):** Frontend prototypes successfully mocked the core Living Map concept, AI Daily Briefing, and basic organizational context (Goals, Teams, Depts).
*   **Technical Validation (Slice 1):** Established core backend (FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL, Alembic), implemented Google SSO authentication (OAuth2, JWT), created initial User/Tenant models, integrated Google Calendar API, and connected the frontend to display real user/calendar data. Introduced rudimentary manager linking.
*   **Pilot MVP (Slice 2):** Delivered the functional MVP centered on the Living Map. Implemented backend models/APIs for Projects, Goals, and basic Notes. Built the `/map/data` API. Developed the interactive frontend `LivingMap` component using react-flow, including node/edge styling, pan/zoom, hover/click interactions, and the contextual `BriefingPanel` populated with entity data. Added basic project creation and note-taking.
*   **Map Polish & Scalability Foundations (Slice 3):** Refined map visuals and interactions. Initiated scalability work by implementing contextual loading (center node + depth) in the `/map/data` backend endpoint.
*   **Filtering & Goal Alignment (Slice 4):** Added frontend map filtering controls (node type). Enhanced Goal management backend/frontend, enabling linking goals to projects and visualizing hierarchies on the map.
*   **Clustering Implementation (Slice 5):** Implemented backend-driven team clustering logic in `/map/data` based on a threshold and frontend toggle integration.
*   **Enterprise Scale Foundations (Slice 6 - Partial):** Introduced frontend semantic zoom LOD, facet filters UI, mini-map/search UI. Added backend foundations for property-graph tables, recursive CTE endpoint, pre-computed views, delta stream service concepts, and caching.

## 3. Architecture & Foundation Assessment

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Clear Vision:** Strong focus on the differentiating "Living Map" UX.
    *   **Solid Technical Choices:** Documented ADRs (Multi-Tenant, Python/FastAPI, Modular Monolith) provide a sensible foundation.
    *   **Good Structure:** Backend adheres to defined modular structure; frontend componentization is advancing.
    *   **Proactive Scalability:** Early consideration and foundational work for handling larger datasets.
    *   **Evolving Data Model:** Use of JSONB and recognition of future need for a graph database provide flexibility.
*   **Areas for Attention / Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incomplete Scalability Implementation:** Key frontend performance pieces (WebGL renderer, dynamic clustering UI, viewport loading) are not yet complete.
    *   **AI Integration Gap:** The "Adaptive Intelligence" pillar remains largely conceptual; core AI value is not yet implemented.
    *   **Limited Collaboration Features:** Native features beyond basic notes are missing.
    *   **Frontend Clustering Logic:** Needs implementation (`FE-TASK-058`) to utilize Slice 5 backend work.
    *   **Test Coverage:** Needs ongoing attention to ensure robustness.

## 4. Slice 7 Plan: "AI Insights & Deeper Alignment"

*   **Goal:** To validate the core value proposition by demonstrating unique AI-driven insights and alignment capabilities within the Living Map context, directly addressing persona needs and the "aligner/innovation engine" mission. Shift focus from pure infrastructure scaling to tangible AI features.

*   **Key Features / Tasks:**
    *   **BE/FE-TASK-S7.1: Basic AI Daily Briefing Generation:**
        *   Integrate backend with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI).
        *   Create a backend service/endpoint to generate a simple narrative summary based on fetched calendar events, recent user activity (e.g., notes created/viewed), and potentially basic project status changes.
        *   Update the frontend `DailyBriefingPanel` to display this generated summary.
    *   **BE/FE-TASK-S7.2: Surface Initial AI Insights (Examples):**
        *   **BE:** Implement backend logic to identify projects with overlapping keywords/descriptions (simple TF-IDF or embedding similarity). Expose this via `/map/data` metadata or a separate insights endpoint.
        *   **FE:** Visually indicate potential project overlaps/synergies on the map (e.g., subtle link highlight, icon in Briefing Panel) based on backend data.
        *   **BE/FE:** Enhance `/map/data` or panels to highlight projects linked to Goals marked "At Risk" or nearing deadlines.
    *   **FE-TASK-S7.3: Enhance Map Interactivity/Density:**
        *   Implement node expansion/collapse for clustered teams (`FE-TASK-058` completion).
        *   Display more context in `BriefingPanel` or on hover (e.g., recent note titles, linked goal status).
    *   **FE-TASK-S7.4: Refine Goal Alignment Visualization:**
        *   Improve UI/UX for creating/editing goals and linking them to projects directly from the map/panels.
        *   Ensure goal hierarchy and project alignment links are visually clear and intuitive on the map.
    *   **BE/FE-TASK-S7.5: Basic Knowledge Asset Linking (Placeholder):**
        *   **FE:** Add UI elements (e.g., in Project panel) to simulate linking external documents (Drive/OneDrive). Initially, this might just store a URL or identifier locally or in project properties.
        *   **BE (Optional):** If feasible, create a simple `KnowledgeAsset` link model/API to persist these links associated with projects/users.
        *   **FE:** Display linked assets as simple nodes or list items connected to the relevant project/user on the map/panel.

*   **Rationale:** This slice directly tackles the current "AI gap" by introducing the first LLM integration and tangible AI-driven insights. It enhances the map's utility for understanding alignment (Goals) and potential collaboration opportunities (project overlap insight). These features are crucial for demonstrating the unique value beyond just visualizing structure, moving closer to validating the core mission with potential pilot users.

## 5. Mission Alignment Check

Slice 7 represents a critical step towards fulfilling the KnowledgePlane AI mission. While the foundational map provides visibility, Slice 7 aims to introduce the *intelligence* layer. By generating summaries, highlighting risks/opportunities (alignment, overlap), and making goal connections more tangible within the map context, we begin demonstrating how KnowledgePlane can actively function as an **organizational aligner and innovation engine**, rather than just a passive visualization tool. Successfully delivering these features will provide the first concrete validation points for the core value proposition.
