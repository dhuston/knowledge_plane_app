## MVP Phasing & Demo Strategy

To balance the need for rapid demonstration (for VCs, early customers) with building a robust platform, the MVP rollout is planned in slices:

### Slice 0: The Vision Demo (Target: Weeks)

*   **Goal:** Create a visually compelling frontend prototype demonstrating the *essence* of KnowledgePlane AI's value proposition. Prioritize speed and impact over fully functional backend systems.
*   **Target Audience:** VCs, potential early pilot customers.
*   **Technology Focus:** Frontend-heavy (React/Vue + TypeScript), high-fidelity UI/UX, minimal/mock backend (hardcoded data or simple mock server).

*   **Key User Stories Represented & Simulation Strategy:**

    1.  **Login/Onboarding:**
        *   *Stories Represented:* Secure Login (Google/Microsoft).
        *   *Simulation:* Fake login screen; clicking proceeds immediately to workspace for a single, predefined demo user profile. No real auth.

    2.  **Workspace View & AI Daily Briefing:**
        *   *Stories Represented:* Workspace View, AI Daily Briefing Display & Content.
        *   *Simulation:* Workspace UI loads post-fake-login. "Daily Briefing" section displays compelling, pre-written static text simulating AI summary (showcasing potential insights from meetings, mentions, documents). Key entities visually styled (links non-functional).

    3.  **Basic Org Context Display:**
        *   *Stories Represented:* Basic Profile Info, Display Inferred Manager/Team.
        *   *Simulation:* Accessible basic profile page displaying hardcoded info for the demo user (fake manager, fake team name). Simple text-based representation.

    4.  **Minimal Collaboration Hub:**
        *   *Stories Represented:* Create Hub, Add Notes/Updates, Invite Users.
        *   *Simulation:* "Create Hub" button navigates to a static example hub page. Input fields for notes/invites are visual only (no persistence/action). One or two static example hubs are viewable with hardcoded content.

    5.  **Integration Placeholders:**
        *   *Stories Represented:* Intelligent Overlay Placeholders.
        *   *Simulation:* Workspace UI includes non-functional visual sections/icons labeled "Calendar," "Slack," "Jira," "Drive," etc., indicating future integration points.

*   **Deliberate Omissions:** Real auth, real API integrations, actual AI logic, database persistence, real-time features, backend infrastructure, integration agent.

### Slice 1: The Technical Validation Alpha (Target: + ~1-2 Months after Slice 0)

*   **Goal:** Replace core mocks with real backend plumbing for key pathways. Validate core technical assumptions.
*   **Target Audience:** Internal team, potentially trusted advisors/friends & family.
*   **Technology Focus:** Implement core backend services (User, Workspace, basic Integration, basic AI templating), real SSO (1 provider), real Calendar auth/pull (1 provider), basic DB persistence.
*   *(Detailed scope TBD based on Slice 0 progress and technical priorities)*

### Slice 2: The Pilot MVP (Target: + ~2-3 Months after Slice 1)

*   **Goal:** Deliver the full MVP scope as defined in the Epics below, ready for carefully selected pilot customers.
*   **Target Audience:** Initial pilot customers.
*   **Technology Focus:** Complete MVP features, robust integration handling, basic monitoring/logging, initial deployment pipeline.
