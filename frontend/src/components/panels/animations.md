# Animation and Transition Enhancements for Context Panels

This document outlines the animation and transition enhancements implemented for the context panels in the Living Map visualization.

## Animation Types Implemented

### 1. Panel Opening/Closing Animations
- Added smooth scaling and fade transitions for panel opening and closing
- Implemented `ScaleFade` for the main panel container with optimized duration and easing
- Used motion variants for staggered child animations when opening the panel

### 2. Transitions Between Different Entity Views
- Created entity-specific transitions with visual cues based on entity type
- Implemented a colored accent bar at the top that smoothly transitions between entity types
- Added staggered animations for entity details, showing content progressively
- Used key-based animations to ensure proper re-rendering when switching entities

### 3. Loading State Animations
- Enhanced loading skeletons with pulse animations
- Created staggered loading state for multiple elements
- Added progress indicators with animated transitions
- Improved perceived performance by showing loading state immediately

### 4. Micro-interactions for Better User Engagement
- Added hover effects with subtle scaling and shadow transitions
- Implemented spring-based animations for interactive elements like buttons
- Created animated chevron rotations for expandable sections
- Added subtle active/pressed state animations

## Animation Components and Hooks

### AnimatedTransition Component
A reusable component that provides consistent animations across the application:
- Supports multiple animation presets (fade, slide, scale)
- Honors user preferences for reduced motion
- Implements directional transitions
- Provides staggered children animations
- Allows customization of duration, delay, and easing

### useAnimatedTab Hook
A custom hook that manages tab transitions:
- Tracks previous and current tab states
- Determines appropriate transition direction
- Manages animation timing and state
- Provides a clean API for component integration

## Accessibility Considerations

- All animations respect the user's "prefers-reduced-motion" setting
- Focus states are maintained during transitions
- Animations do not interfere with keyboard navigation
- ARIA attributes are properly maintained during transitions

## Performance Optimizations

- Used hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) for smooth animations
- Implemented animation throttling for performance-sensitive operations
- Leveraged staggered animations to distribute rendering load
- Cached and reused animation definitions to prevent recreation
- Used motion variants to optimize animation definitions

## Implementation Details

The primary components enhanced with animations are:
1. `ContextPanel.tsx` - Main panel container animations
2. `RelationshipList.tsx` - Relationship group animations
3. `EntityPanel` components - Entity-specific micro-interactions
4. Loading states across all components
5. Tab transitions between different content views

These enhancements greatly improve the user experience by providing visual feedback, creating a more engaging interface, and making the application feel more polished and professional.
