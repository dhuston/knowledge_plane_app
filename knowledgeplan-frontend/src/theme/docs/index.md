# KnowledgePlane AI Design System

## Overview

The KnowledgePlane AI Design System provides a comprehensive framework for creating consistent, accessible, and visually appealing user interfaces. This design system supports the creation of enterprise-ready applications that scale from mobile devices to large desktop displays, with support for both light and dark modes.

## Core Principles

1. **Consistency**: Maintain visual and behavioral consistency throughout the application
2. **Scalability**: Support enterprise-scale data visualization and interaction
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure all interfaces are accessible to all users
4. **Performance**: Optimize for performance across all devices and network conditions
5. **Modularity**: Build from reusable components that can be combined in flexible ways

## Getting Started

### For Designers

1. Review the design tokens and component documentation
2. Access the Figma design library (coming soon)
3. Follow the guidelines for responsive design, dark mode, and accessibility

### For Developers

1. Import components from the theme directory
2. Use the Chakra UI theme provider with our custom theme
3. Leverage responsive utilities and theme tokens for consistent implementation

## Contributing

To contribute to the design system:

1. Follow the established patterns and principles
2. Document new components and variations
3. Ensure all components meet accessibility standards
4. Test across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes
5. Submit changes through the standard pull request process

## Future Roadmap

- Figma component library synchronized with code components
- Interactive component documentation with Storybook
- Additional specialized components for data visualization
- Performance optimization for large-scale data rendering
