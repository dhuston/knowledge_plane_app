# KnowledgePlane AI Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines the accessibility standards and best practices for the KnowledgePlane AI application, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively use the platform.

## Core Principles

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable by all users.
3. **Understandable**: Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Standards Compliance

The KnowledgePlane AI application aims to comply with:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at the AA level
- **Section 508**: Requirements for federal agencies in the United States
- **EN 301 549**: European accessibility requirements for ICT products and services

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Color and Contrast

- Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background (3:1 for large text)
- UI components and graphical objects must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors
- Never use color alone to convey information; combine with text, patterns, or icons
- Support high contrast mode for operating systems that offer it

### Typography

- Use a minimum text size of 16px for body text
- Maintain appropriate line height (1.5 for body text, 1.2 for headings)
- Ensure adequate letter and word spacing
- Avoid justified text, which can create "rivers" of white space
- Use relative units (rem, em) rather than fixed pixels

### Focus Indicators

- Ensure all interactive elements have a visible focus indicator
- Focus indicators should have a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1
- Default focus styles should not be removed without providing an enhanced alternative
- Consider providing enhanced focus styles that are more visible than browser defaults

## Content Guidelines

### Text Alternatives

- Provide text alternatives for all non-text content
- Image `alt` text should be concise and descriptive
- Complex images (charts, diagrams) should have detailed descriptions
- Decorative images should have empty alt text (`alt=""`)
- Use ARIA labels for interactive elements without visible text

### Page Structure

- Use proper heading levels (H1-H6) to maintain a logical document outline
- Organize content using appropriate semantic elements (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Ensure tab order follows a logical sequence
- Provide "skip to content" links for keyboard users

### Forms

- Associate labels with form controls using `<label>` elements
- Group related form elements with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
- Provide clear error messages and validation feedback
- Ensure form fields have adequate descriptions and instructions
- Support both mouse and keyboard inputs for all form interactions

## Interactive Elements

### Keyboard Accessibility

- Ensure all functionality is operable with a keyboard alone
- Do not trap keyboard focus within components
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions
- Make focus visible and logical at all times
- Test tab order to ensure it follows visual layout

### Touch and Pointer

- Ensure touch targets are at least 44Ã—44 pixels
- Provide adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Support standard touch gestures (tap, swipe, pinch)
- Ensure drag operations have keyboard alternatives

### Input Modalities

- Support multiple input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch, voice)
- Do not require specific gestures for essential functions
- Provide alternatives for motion-based interactions

## Time-Based Media

### Video and Audio

- Provide captions for all video content
- Provide transcripts for all audio content
- Allow user control of audio and video playback
- Avoid auto-playing media with sound

### Animations

- Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second (to prevent seizures)
- Allow users to pause, stop, or hide any moving, blinking, or scrolling content
- Respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

## Specific Component Guidelines

### Navigation

- Provide consistent navigation patterns throughout the application
- Clearly indicate the current location within the interface
- Include breadcrumbs for complex hierarchical structures
- Ensure dropdown menus are accessible via keyboard

### Modals and Dialogs

- Trap focus within modal dialogs while they are open
- Provide a clear way to close the dialog (using both mouse and keyboard)
- Return focus to the triggering element when the dialog is closed
- Ensure screen readers announce the dialog when it opens

### Data Tables

- Use proper table markup with headers (`<th>`) and data cells (`<td>`)
- Include appropriate scope attributes (`scope="col"` or `scope="row"`)
- Provide captions and summaries for complex tables
- Consider responsive alternatives for small screens

### Living Map Visualization

- Provide keyboard navigation for map exploration
- Ensure color choices are perceivable by colorblind users
- Offer alternative views or data representations (e.g., list view)
- Provide text descriptions of important map features and patterns
- Ensure zoom controls and interactive elements are keyboard accessible

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing

- Integrate accessibility linting in the development process
- Use tools like axe-core, Lighthouse, or WAVE for automated testing
- Include accessibility checks in CI/CD pipelines

### Manual Testing

- Perform keyboard navigation testing for all flows
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Validate color contrast at all breakpoints
- Test with browser zoom at 200%
- Test with high contrast mode enabled

### User Testing

- Include users with disabilities in user testing sessions
- Test with a variety of assistive technologies
- Document and address accessibility feedback from users

## Implementation Resources

### ARIA Roles and Attributes

Use ARIA roles and attributes appropriately:

```jsx
// Example of a tab interface with ARIA
<div role="tablist">
  <button 
    role="tab" 
    id="tab1" 
    aria-selected="true" 
    aria-controls="panel1"
  >
    Tab 1
  </button>
  <button 
    role="tab" 
    id="tab2" 
    aria-selected="false" 
    aria-controls="panel2"
  >
    Tab 2
  </button>
</div>
<div 
  id="panel1" 
  role="tabpanel" 
  aria-labelledby="tab1"
>
  Tab 1 content
</div>
<div 
  id="panel2" 
  role="tabpanel" 
  aria-labelledby="tab2" 
  hidden
>
  Tab 2 content
</div>
```

### Focus Management

Control focus programmatically when needed:

```jsx
// Example of managing focus in a React component
function Modal({ isOpen, onClose, children }) {
  const modalRef = useRef(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isOpen) {
      // Move focus to the modal when it opens
      modalRef.current.focus();
    }
    
    return () => {
      // Return focus to the trigger element when modal closes
      triggerButton.current.focus();
    };
  }, [isOpen]);
  
  return isOpen ? (
    <div 
      ref={modalRef}
      role="dialog"
      aria-modal="true"
      tabIndex="-1"
    >
      {children}
      <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
    </div>
  ) : null;
}
```
