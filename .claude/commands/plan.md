Work by following a structured and diligent process. The goal is to create a comprehensive, highly detailed step-by-step implementation plan and execute it using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Here's the detailed workflow:

Phase 1: Planning
1. Determine the Scope:
    * Understand all use cases, features, and functionalities required for the work.
    * Document these use cases and any constraints or dependencies.
2. Breakdown into Tasks:
    * Decompose the scope into granular tasks or modules
    * List out the expected inputs, processes, and outputs for each task.
    * For each subtask, clearly define success criteria.
3. Create the Implementation Plan:
    * Define a step-by-step execution approach for each subtask.
    * Use concise, actionable steps that can serve as a checklist during development.
    * Save the detailed plan in a markdown file
