# WebGL Renderer Research for KnowledgePlane AI

## Goals

1. Identify the most suitable WebGL-based graph rendering solution for the KnowledgePlane Living Map
2. Ensure it can handle enterprise-scale data (5,000+ nodes at 60+ FPS) 
3. Support all required interaction patterns (pan, zoom, selection, hover)
4. Maintain visual consistency with our design system

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses two approaches:
1. **React Flow** (SVG-based) - Main implementation
2. **react-force-graph-2d** (WebGL-based) - Experimental implementation

Both implementations have limitations for enterprise scale:
- SVG-based rendering slows dramatically with larger node counts
- Current WebGL implementation lacks visual polish and full feature support

## Candidates for Evaluation

1. **react-force-graph (WebGL)**
   - Pros: Already partially implemented, good performance, active development
   - Cons: Limited styling flexibility, may need custom shaders for enterprise look

2. **Sigma.js**
   - Pros: Pure WebGL renderer, highly performant, supports large graphs
   - Cons: Less React integration, steeper learning curve, custom styling needed

3. **PixiJS + custom implementation**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, extremely fast, full control of rendering pipeline
   - Cons: Requires significant custom development, no built-in graph layout

4. **CytoscapeJS with cytoscape-gl extension**
   - Pros: Comprehensive graph library, good ecosystem, WebGL acceleration
   - Cons: Not pure WebGL, may hit performance limits at very large scales

5. **G6 (AntV) with WebGL Renderer**
   - Pros: Enterprise-ready, good documentation, active development
   - Cons: Less common in western companies, may have integration challenges

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll evaluate each renderer against these criteria:

1. **Performance**
   - Raw rendering speed (FPS) at 5K nodes
   - Memory usage and initialization time
   - Interaction responsiveness

2. **Feature Support**
   - Node/edge styling flexibility
   - Custom rendering capabilities
   - Interaction handling (pan, zoom, hover, click)
   - Layout algorithms available

3. **Developer Experience**
   - React integration ease
   - Documentation quality
   - Learning curve
   - Community support

4. **Enterprise Readiness**
   - Visual polish capability
   - Accessibility support
   - Touch device support
   - Browser compatibility

## Testing Approach

1. Create benchmark dataset with 5,000 nodes and 10,000 edges
2. Implement basic rendering with each candidate
3. Measure performance metrics:
   - Initial render time
   - FPS during interactions
   - Memory usage
4. Implement key interactions (node selection, hover effects)
5. Evaluate visual styling capabilities against our design system

## Timeline

1. Initial research and prototype implementations: 1 week
2. Performance testing and benchmarking: 2-3 days
3. Visual styling tests: 2 days
4. Final evaluation and decision: 1 day
5. Implementation of chosen renderer in main codebase: 1 week

## Initial Findings

Based on preliminary research:

- **react-force-graph** offers the quickest path forward since we already have partial implementation
- **Sigma.js** likely offers the best pure performance with large graphs
- **PixiJS** provides the most flexibility but requires most custom development

## Next Steps

1. Create synthetic test datasets of various sizes (1K, 5K, 10K nodes)
2. Implement basic rendering in each candidate framework
3. Run automated benchmarks to gather performance metrics
