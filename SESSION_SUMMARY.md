# KnowledgePlane AI - Development Session Summary

**Date:** 4/13/25

**Goal:** Document the progress, decisions, and key learnings from the development session covering Slices 0, 0.5, and the beginning of Slice 1.

---

## Overall Progress:

*   **Slice 0 (Vision Demo):** Completed. Focused on building a high-fidelity frontend prototype using React, TypeScript, Chakra UI, and Vite. Implemented mock UI for Login, Workspace (Briefing, Hub List, Integrations), Profile, and Project Hub pages with static data and simulated navigation.
*   **Slice 0.5 (Vision Demo - Org Context):** Completed. Enhanced the demo by adding mocked views and data representing organizational structure and alignment. Added Goals page, Team page, Department page, and linked these entities contextually across the UI to better illustrate the "Emergent Organizational Model" concept.
*   **Slice 1 (Technical Validation Alpha):** Started. Focused on building the foundational backend infrastructure.
    *   Completed Backend Core Setup (FastAPI project structure, Poetry, Docker).
    *   Completed Database Setup (PostgreSQL via Docker, SQLAlchemy models for User/Tenant, Alembic migrations setup and initial migration applied).
    *   Completed initial Backend Authentication steps (Google OAuth2 config, redirect flow, callback handling with user upsert, JWT generation).
    *   Completed initial Backend API steps (User schemas, CRUD stubs, basic security dependencies).
    *   Completed initial Backend Integration steps (Calendar API client setup, endpoint for fetching events).
    *   Completed initial Frontend Integration steps (Login redirect, Auth callback handling, API client setup).

## Key Technical Decisions & Architecture:

*   **Architecture:** Initial approach revised from Microservices to **Modular Monolith** (FastAPI backend + React SPA frontend) for faster iteration, with potential for later extraction of modules.
*   **Backend:** **Python** chosen as primary language, with **FastAPI** as the framework (due to strong AI/ML ecosystem and performance).
*   **Frontend:** **React** with **TypeScript** and **Chakra UI**.
*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** (via AWS RDS eventually) for core relational data. **Graph Database** (e.g., AWS Neptune) planned for later Org Model Service.
*   **Deployment:** **Multi-Tenant SaaS** on **AWS**. Addressed via ADR.
*   **Local Development:** **Docker Compose** for running backend + database.
*   **Dependency Management:** **Poetry** for backend, **npm** for frontend.
*   **Authentication:** **SSO** (Google OAuth2 initially) with **JWT** for session management.
*   **Integrations:** Direct cloud APIs + **Customer-Managed Agent** model for internal tools.
*   **Documentation:** Centralized `/docs` directory structure established with ADRs, Vision, Architecture, Onboarding, Data Model files.

## Key UX/Product Decisions:

*   Introduced **Slice 0.5** to better demonstrate organizational context (Goals, Teams, Departments) crucial for the product vision.
*   Refined **Vision/Value Prop** to emphasize revealing the *emergent* organizational structure vs. just the decreed org chart.
*   Brainstormed **novel UX patterns** for metadata input/tagging (inline linking, connect action, AI suggestions) and simulated aspects in the Slice 0.5 UI.
*   Focused on **contextual linking** between entities (People, Projects, Teams, Depts, Goals) in the UI to visually represent the knowledge graph.

## Challenges & Learnings:

*   **Dependency Conflicts:** Encountered issues with Chakra UI v2 vs v3 and React 19, resolved by standardizing on Chakra UI v2.
*   **Docker Build Issues:** Faced multiple Docker build failures due to Python version mismatches, incorrect Poetry flags (`--no-root`, `--only main`), missing READMEs during package install, and incorrect venv path handling. Resolved through iterative refinement of the `Dockerfile`.
*   **Backend Runtime Errors:** Addressed `ModuleNotFound` errors (e.g., `jose`, `passlib`, `pydantic_settings`) by ensuring dependencies were correctly added via Poetry and included in the Docker build. Fixed `AttributeError` related to schema imports (`app.schemas.User`). Resolved Authlib `AssertionError` by adding `SessionMiddleware`.
*   **Database Connection Errors:** Resolved `socket.gaierror` (hostname resolution) and `InvalidPasswordError` / `ConnectionRefusedError` by correctly configuring host/port via environment variables for local Alembic runs and managing Docker volumes.
*   **Frontend Tooling Issues:** Encountered spurious linter errors related to Chakra UI types; adopted a strategy to ignore these specific warnings after verification. Addressed React Hook order errors by moving all hook calls before conditional returns.
*   **Mock Data Management:** Centralizing mock data is preferred but refactoring existing components to use the central source via automated edits proved difficult and error-prone; manual updates or more robust tooling might be needed.
*   **Kanban Tooling:** Automated edits to Kanban Markdown files were unreliable.

## Next Steps (Start of Slice 1 Continued):

*   Implement JWT verification dependency (`get_current_user` in `security.py`).
*   Implement `/users/me` API endpoint.
*   Integrate frontend to use real auth token and fetch user data.
*   Integrate frontend to fetch and display real calendar data.
*   Integrate frontend to display real manager link.

## Session Summary - April 14th, 2025

**Goal:** Complete Slice 1 core functionality, including fixing authentication issues, integrating backend data into the frontend, and seeding basic organizational structure.

**Overall Progress (Completion of Slice 1):**

*   **Resolved Google OAuth Issues:**
    *   Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'itsdangerous'` by adding the dependency.
    *   Resolved `redirect_uri_mismatch` by verifying and correcting the URI in Google Cloud Console.
    *   Resolved `invalid_scope` by removing the unnecessary `directory.users.readonly` scope from backend config.
    *   Resolved `access_denied` (403) by adding the test user email to the OAuth Consent Screen test users.
    *   Fixed `ForeignKeyViolationError` during callback by implementing dynamic tenant lookup/creation based on email domain (created `crud_tenant.py`, `schemas/tenant.py`, updated `endpoints/auth.py`).
    *   Resolved various `ImportError` issues (`UserInDB`, `app.crud.base`) through code correction and ensuring clean backend startup.
    *   Diagnosed and fixed frontend/backend state timing issues preventing token usage after callback redirect (simplified `AuthCallbackPage`, corrected `AuthProvider` placement within `BrowserRouter`).
*   **Fixed CORS Issues:**
    *   Added `CORSMiddleware` to backend `main.py`.
    *   Diagnosed CORS errors blocking `/users/{id}` calls, revealing an underlying `ResponseValidationError` due to incorrect Pydantic schema types (`UUID` vs `string`).
    *   Corrected UUID type hints in `schemas/user.py`.
*   **Completed Backend API Endpoints (Slice 1):**
    *   `get_current_user` dependency fully functional.
    *   `/users/me` functional (implicitly tested via `AuthContext`).
    *   `/users/{user_id}` endpoint created and functional.
    *   `/teams/{team_id}` endpoint created and functional.
    *   `/integrations/google/calendar/events` endpoint functional:
        *   Resolved Google Calendar API disabled error (403) by enabling the API in Google Cloud Console.
        *   Fixed `TypeError: object dict can't be used in 'await' expression` by using `asyncio.to_thread` for the blocking Google API client call.
        *   Fixed issue where Google OAuth token wasn't being saved to DB during callback by ensuring `upsert_by_auth` correctly handled updates with `UserCreate` schema.
*   **Completed Frontend Integration (Slice 1):**
    *   `FE-TASK-034`: `MainLayout` user menu displays real user name/avatar. `ProfilePage` displays real profile data.
    *   `FE-TASK-035`: `WorkspacePage` fetches and displays real Google Calendar events and count.
    *   `FE-TASK-036`: `ProfilePage` fetches and displays the Manager's name (if `manager_id` exists).
*   **Seeded Basic Org Data:**
    *   Created `Team` model, schemas, basic CRUD, and applied migrations.
    *   Resolved Poetry/Alembic environment issues (`getaddrinfo failed`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, `NameError`, `DuplicateColumnError`) by fixing local DB connection logic, path setup in `env.py`, cleaning Poetry cache/environment, and modifying migration script.
    *   Created `scripts/seed_data.py` to create sample users (Alice Manager, Bob Report), a sample team (Alpha Team), and link them via `manager_id` and `team_id`.
    *   Updated `ProfilePage` to fetch and display the seeded Team name.
    *   Updated `WorkspacePage` header to display the seeded Team name.
*   **Cleanup:** Removed temporary debugging `console.log` statements from frontend/backend.

**Challenges & Learnings:**

*   Debugging OAuth flows requires careful checking of backend logs, frontend console, network requests, and cloud provider settings.
*   CORS errors can sometimes mask underlying backend exceptions (like response validation errors).
*   Poetry environment/cache corruption can cause confusing errors; removing/recreating environments and clearing caches can resolve them.
*   Running tools like Alembic locally requires careful handling of database connection strings and Python path configuration (`env.py`).
*   Blocking I/O calls (like Google API client) in async code require techniques like `asyncio.to_thread`.
*   Ensure Pydantic schemas accurately reflect data types used by SQLAlchemy models, especially for `response_model` validation.
*   React Context/state updates across navigation require careful handling; ensure provider placement is correct relative to Router.

**Next Steps (Start of Slice 2 or Refinement):**

*   Replace remaining mock data in `WorkspacePage` (Team Members list, Projects, Goals, Activity).
*   Implement Google OAuth token refresh logic.
*   Add more robust authorization checks to backend endpoints.
*   Address `TODO` comments in the codebase.
*   Plan and begin implementation of Slice 2 features (e.g., Project/Goal models and APIs).
