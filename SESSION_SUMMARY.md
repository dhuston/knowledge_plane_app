# KnowledgePlane AI - Development Session Summary

**Date:** 4/13/25

**Goal:** Document the progress, decisions, and key learnings from the development session covering Slices 0, 0.5, and the beginning of Slice 1.

---

## Overall Progress:

*   **Slice 0 (Vision Demo):** Completed. Focused on building a high-fidelity frontend prototype using React, TypeScript, Chakra UI, and Vite. Implemented mock UI for Login, Workspace (Briefing, Hub List, Integrations), Profile, and Project Hub pages with static data and simulated navigation.
*   **Slice 0.5 (Vision Demo - Org Context):** Completed. Enhanced the demo by adding mocked views and data representing organizational structure and alignment. Added Goals page, Team page, Department page, and linked these entities contextually across the UI to better illustrate the "Emergent Organizational Model" concept.
*   **Slice 1 (Technical Validation Alpha):** Started. Focused on building the foundational backend infrastructure.
    *   Completed Backend Core Setup (FastAPI project structure, Poetry, Docker).
    *   Completed Database Setup (PostgreSQL via Docker, SQLAlchemy models for User/Tenant, Alembic migrations setup and initial migration applied).
    *   Completed initial Backend Authentication steps (Google OAuth2 config, redirect flow, callback handling with user upsert, JWT generation).
    *   Completed initial Backend API steps (User schemas, CRUD stubs, basic security dependencies).
    *   Completed initial Backend Integration steps (Calendar API client setup, endpoint for fetching events).
    *   Completed initial Frontend Integration steps (Login redirect, Auth callback handling, API client setup).

## Key Technical Decisions & Architecture:

*   **Architecture:** Initial approach revised from Microservices to **Modular Monolith** (FastAPI backend + React SPA frontend) for faster iteration, with potential for later extraction of modules.
*   **Backend:** **Python** chosen as primary language, with **FastAPI** as the framework (due to strong AI/ML ecosystem and performance).
*   **Frontend:** **React** with **TypeScript** and **Chakra UI**.
*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** (via AWS RDS eventually) for core relational data. **Graph Database** (e.g., AWS Neptune) planned for later Org Model Service.
*   **Deployment:** **Multi-Tenant SaaS** on **AWS**. Addressed via ADR.
*   **Local Development:** **Docker Compose** for running backend + database.
*   **Dependency Management:** **Poetry** for backend, **npm** for frontend.
*   **Authentication:** **SSO** (Google OAuth2 initially) with **JWT** for session management.
*   **Integrations:** Direct cloud APIs + **Customer-Managed Agent** model for internal tools.
*   **Documentation:** Centralized `/docs` directory structure established with ADRs, Vision, Architecture, Onboarding, Data Model files.

## Key UX/Product Decisions:

*   Introduced **Slice 0.5** to better demonstrate organizational context (Goals, Teams, Departments) crucial for the product vision.
*   Refined **Vision/Value Prop** to emphasize revealing the *emergent* organizational structure vs. just the decreed org chart.
*   Brainstormed **novel UX patterns** for metadata input/tagging (inline linking, connect action, AI suggestions) and simulated aspects in the Slice 0.5 UI.
*   Focused on **contextual linking** between entities (People, Projects, Teams, Depts, Goals) in the UI to visually represent the knowledge graph.

## Challenges & Learnings:

*   **Dependency Conflicts:** Encountered issues with Chakra UI v2 vs v3 and React 19, resolved by standardizing on Chakra UI v2.
*   **Docker Build Issues:** Faced multiple Docker build failures due to Python version mismatches, incorrect Poetry flags (`--no-root`, `--only main`), missing READMEs during package install, and incorrect venv path handling. Resolved through iterative refinement of the `Dockerfile`.
*   **Backend Runtime Errors:** Addressed `ModuleNotFound` errors (e.g., `jose`, `passlib`, `pydantic_settings`) by ensuring dependencies were correctly added via Poetry and included in the Docker build. Fixed `AttributeError` related to schema imports (`app.schemas.User`). Resolved Authlib `AssertionError` by adding `SessionMiddleware`.
*   **Database Connection Errors:** Resolved `socket.gaierror` (hostname resolution) and `InvalidPasswordError` / `ConnectionRefusedError` by correctly configuring host/port via environment variables for local Alembic runs and managing Docker volumes.
*   **Frontend Tooling Issues:** Encountered spurious linter errors related to Chakra UI types; adopted a strategy to ignore these specific warnings after verification. Addressed React Hook order errors by moving all hook calls before conditional returns.
*   **Mock Data Management:** Centralizing mock data is preferred but refactoring existing components to use the central source via automated edits proved difficult and error-prone; manual updates or more robust tooling might be needed.
*   **Kanban Tooling:** Automated edits to Kanban Markdown files were unreliable.

## Next Steps (Start of Slice 1 Continued):

*   Implement JWT verification dependency (`get_current_user` in `security.py`).
*   Implement `/users/me` API endpoint.
*   Integrate frontend to use real auth token and fetch user data.
*   Integrate frontend to fetch and display real calendar data.
*   Integrate frontend to display real manager link. 

---

## Session Summary - April 14th, 2025

**Goal:** Complete Slice 1 core functionality, including fixing authentication issues, integrating backend data into the frontend, and seeding basic organizational structure.

**Overall Progress (Completion of Slice 1):**

*   **Resolved Google OAuth Issues:**
    *   Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'itsdangerous'` by adding the dependency.
    *   Resolved `redirect_uri_mismatch` by verifying and correcting the URI in Google Cloud Console.
    *   Resolved `invalid_scope` by removing the unnecessary `directory.users.readonly` scope from backend config.
    *   Resolved `access_denied` (403) by adding the test user email to the OAuth Consent Screen test users.
    *   Fixed `ForeignKeyViolationError` during callback by implementing dynamic tenant lookup/creation based on email domain (created `crud_tenant.py`, `schemas/tenant.py`, updated `endpoints/auth.py`).
    *   Resolved various `ImportError` issues (`UserInDB`, `app.crud.base`) through code correction and ensuring clean backend startup.
    *   Diagnosed and fixed frontend/backend state timing issues preventing token usage after callback redirect (simplified `AuthCallbackPage`, corrected `AuthProvider` placement within `BrowserRouter`).
*   **Fixed CORS Issues:**
    *   Added `CORSMiddleware` to backend `main.py`.
    *   Diagnosed CORS errors blocking `/users/{id}` calls, revealing an underlying `ResponseValidationError` due to incorrect Pydantic schema types (`UUID` vs `string`).
    *   Corrected UUID type hints in `schemas/user.py`.
*   **Completed Backend API Endpoints (Slice 1):**
    *   `get_current_user` dependency fully functional.
    *   `/users/me` functional (implicitly tested via `AuthContext`).
    *   `/users/{user_id}` endpoint created and functional.
    *   `/teams/{team_id}` endpoint created and functional.
    *   `/integrations/google/calendar/events` endpoint functional:
        *   Resolved Google Calendar API disabled error (403) by enabling the API in Google Cloud Console.
        *   Fixed `TypeError: object dict can't be used in 'await' expression` by using `asyncio.to_thread` for the blocking Google API client call.
        *   Fixed issue where Google OAuth token wasn't being saved to DB during callback by ensuring `upsert_by_auth` correctly handled updates with `UserCreate` schema.
*   **Completed Frontend Integration (Slice 1):**
    *   `FE-TASK-034`: `MainLayout` user menu displays real user name/avatar. `ProfilePage` displays real profile data.
    *   `FE-TASK-035`: `WorkspacePage` fetches and displays real Google Calendar events and count.
    *   `FE-TASK-036`: `ProfilePage` fetches and displays the Manager's name (if `manager_id` exists).
*   **Seeded Basic Org Data:**
    *   Created `Team` model, schemas, basic CRUD, and applied migrations.
    *   Resolved Poetry/Alembic environment issues (`getaddrinfo failed`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, `NameError`, `DuplicateColumnError`) by fixing local DB connection logic, path setup in `env.py`, cleaning Poetry cache/environment, and modifying migration script.
    *   Created `scripts/seed_data.py` to create sample users (Alice Manager, Bob Report), a sample team (Alpha Team), and link them via `manager_id` and `team_id`.
    *   Updated `ProfilePage` to fetch and display the seeded Team name.
    *   Updated `WorkspacePage` header to display the seeded Team name.
*   **Cleanup:** Removed temporary debugging `console.log` statements from frontend/backend.

**Challenges & Learnings:**

*   Debugging OAuth flows requires careful checking of backend logs, frontend console, network requests, and cloud provider settings.
*   CORS errors can sometimes mask underlying backend exceptions (like response validation errors).
*   Poetry environment/cache corruption can cause confusing errors; removing/recreating environments and clearing caches can resolve them.
*   Running tools like Alembic locally requires careful handling of database connection strings and Python path configuration (`env.py`).
*   Blocking I/O calls (like Google API client) in async code require techniques like `asyncio.to_thread`.
*   Ensure Pydantic schemas accurately reflect data types used by SQLAlchemy models, especially for `response_model` validation.
*   React Context/state updates across navigation require careful handling; ensure provider placement is correct relative to Router.

**Next Steps (Start of Slice 2 or Refinement):**

*   Replace remaining mock data in `WorkspacePage` (Team Members list, Projects, Goals, Activity).
*   Implement Google OAuth token refresh logic.
*   Add more robust authorization checks to backend endpoints.
*   Address `TODO` comments in the codebase.
*   Plan and begin implementation of Slice 2 features (e.g., Project/Goal models and APIs).

## UX Vision Update - April 19th, 2025

**Note:** A significant refinement of the core UX vision was introduced, centering the application experience around an interactive, AI-powered **"Living Map"** of the organization's work fabric. This includes concepts like dynamic visualization of entities (people, projects, goals, knowledge) and relationships, contextual overlays/panels, an Org Time Machine, and a Scenario Simulator.

This "Living Map" concept supersedes earlier, more fragmented workspace/overlay ideas and will guide the design and implementation priorities moving forward, particularly for Slice 2 (Pilot MVP) and beyond. Relevant documentation (Vision, Architecture, Backlog, Data Model) has been updated to reflect this direction. 

---

## Session Summary - April 20th, 2025

**Goal:** Expand the data model to include Projects, Goals, and Knowledge Assets, seed comprehensive sample data, and prepare the backend for the "Living Map" visualization.

**Overall Progress:**

*   **Expanded Backend Models & Schemas:**
    *   Added `Project`, `Goal`, and `KnowledgeAsset` SQLAlchemy models (`models/`).
    *   Added `KnowledgeAssetTypeEnum` with initial values (`NOTE`, `DOCUMENT`, `MESSAGE`, `MEETING`).
    *   Created corresponding Pydantic schemas (`schemas/`).
*   **Updated Model Relationships:**
    *   Added `User` -> `KnowledgeAsset` relationship.
    *   Added `Project` -> `User` (owner), `Project` -> `Team`, `Project` -> `Goal` relationships.
*   **Database Migrations:**
    *   Generated and applied migration `2d117f7393a2` for the new models and relationships.
*   **Expanded Seed Script (`scripts/seed_data.py`):**
    *   Enhanced script to create sample Departments, Teams, Users (with manager/team links).
    *   Added logic to create sample Projects (with owners/teams) and Goals.
    *   Added logic to link Projects to Goals.
    *   Added logic to create sample Knowledge Assets (initially with existing types) linked to Users/Projects.
*   **Added New Knowledge Asset Types:**
    *   Added `REPORT`, `SUBMISSION`, `PRESENTATION` to `KnowledgeAssetTypeEnum` (`models/knowledge_asset.py`).
    *   Generated migration `f5081054e612` to add these new enum values to the database.
*   **Resolved Enum Migration Issues:**
    *   Diagnosed that initial `alembic upgrade` and `seed_data.py` runs were targeting the wrong database instance (local `localhost:5433` vs Docker `db:5432`).
    *   Executed `alembic upgrade head` and `python scripts/seed_data.py` within the `backend` Docker container using `docker-compose exec` to target the correct database.
    *   Identified persistent `InvalidTextRepresentationError` for the new enum values even when targeting the correct DB.
    *   Modified migration `f5081054e612` to explicitly `DROP TYPE` and `CREATE TYPE` for `knowledgeassettypeenum` instead of using `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`.
    *   Successfully applied the modified migration and ran the seed script within the container.

**Challenges & Learnings:**

*   PostgreSQL enum modifications (`ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`) can sometimes be problematic or have caching issues when used via Alembic/SQLAlchemy; dropping and recreating the type can be a more reliable (though potentially destructive) workaround.
*   Ensuring that database operations (migrations, seeding) target the correct database instance is crucial, especially when using Docker Compose. Running commands *inside* the relevant container (`docker-compose exec`) is often necessary.
*   Carefully check the logs of commands run both locally and inside containers to understand which database connection is being used.

**Next Steps (Focus on Living Map Implementation - Slice 2 MVP):**

*   **Backend: Living Map API Endpoint:**
    *   Create a new API endpoint (e.g., `/map/data`) in the backend.
    *   This endpoint should query the database for relevant entities (Users, Teams, Projects, Goals, Knowledge Assets) within the user's tenant.
    *   Compute the relationships (edges) between these entities (e.g., User `MEMBER_OF` Team, Project `ALIGNED_TO` Goal, User `OWNS` KnowledgeAsset, etc.).
    *   Define clear API response schemas (`MapData`, `MapNode`, `MapEdge` including `MapNodeTypeEnum`, `MapEdgeTypeEnum`) to structure the data for the frontend.
*   **Frontend: Living Map Component:**
    *   Integrate `react-flow` library (`@reactflow/core`).
    *   Create the `LivingMap.tsx` component.
    *   Fetch data from the `/map/data` backend endpoint.
    *   Implement `transformApiNode` and `transformApiEdge` functions to convert the API response into `react-flow`'s `Node` and `Edge` formats.
    *   Implement basic layouting using a library like `dagre`.
    *   Create custom node components (`UserNode`, `TeamNode`, `ProjectNode`, `GoalNode`, `KnowledgeAssetNode`) matching the visual design concepts.
    *   Implement edge styling based on the `MapEdgeTypeEnum` from the backend.
    *   Connect `onNodeClick` events in the `LivingMap` to update the main panel (e.g., `BriefingPanel`) to show details of the selected entity.
*   **Backend: CRUD APIs (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Implement basic CRUD API endpoints for `Project`, `Goal`, and `KnowledgeAsset` to allow for future data management (might not be strictly needed for initial map *viewing*).
*   **Refinement:**
    *   Address `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings identified in the seed script logs.
    *   Review and refine data model relationships as needed based on map visualization requirements.
    *   Implement Google OAuth token refresh logic.
    *   Add more robust authorization checks to backend endpoints.
    *   Address any remaining `TODO` comments.

## Session Summary - April 20th, 2025 (Continued)

**Goal:** Resolve backend startup issues and achieve initial Living Map data loading.

**Overall Progress:**

*   **Systematic Refactoring & Debugging:**
    *   Diagnosed and fixed a cascade of `ImportError`, `AttributeError`, and `ModuleNotFoundError` issues in the backend originating from inconsistent schema naming (`ProjectRead`, `GoalRead`, `TeamRead`, `UserRead` vs. `Project`, `Goal`, `Team`, `User`), inconsistent dependency import paths (`app.api.deps` vs. `app.core.security`/`app.db.session`), inconsistent CRUD class patterns (removal of `CRUDBase`), and incomplete feature removal (`TokenBlacklist`).
    *   Performed a systematic consistency check across `schemas/`, `api/v1/endpoints/`, `api/routers/`, `crud/`, `models/`, and `main.py` to align schema names, imports, router structure, and CRUD patterns.
*   **Added `Department` Model:**
    *   Successfully created the `Department` model, schemas, CRUD file.
    *   Added the `departments` relationship to the `Tenant` model.
    *   Generated and applied Alembic migrations for the new table and foreign key (`Team.dept_id`).
*   **Resolved SQLAlchemy Errors:**
    *   Fixed `InvalidRequestError` (missing `departments` property on `Tenant` mapper) by adding the corresponding relationship.
    *   Fixed `NoForeignKeysError` and `AmbiguousForeignKeysError` by adding the `dept_id` foreign key to `Team` and explicitly setting `foreign_keys` on the `Team.members` relationship.
*   **Resolved Runtime Errors:**
    *   Fixed `TypeError` in project creation (`crud_project.py`) caused by passing `owner_id` keyword argument when the model expected `owning_team_id`.
    *   Fixed Pydantic `UserError` (`from_attributes=True` missing) for `ProjectRead` and `GoalRead` schemas by updating their base classes (`ProjectInDBBase`, `GoalInDBBase`) to use correct Pydantic V2 config.
    *   Fixed `AttributeError` in `map.py` when calling `crud_team.get` by correcting the import and usage pattern.
    *   Fixed `AttributeError` in `map.py` when querying `Project.owner_id` by changing the query to use the existing `Project.owning_team_id`.
*   **Fixed Frontend Issues:**
    *   Fixed logout redirect loop by navigating to `/map` instead of `/workspace` in `AuthCallbackPage.tsx`.
    *   Fixed `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` by correcting the `API_BASE_URL` port in `useApiClient.ts` to match the `docker-compose.yml` host port (`8001`).
    *   Fixed map data loading error by correcting Axios response handling in `LivingMap.tsx` (`response.data` instead of `response`).
*   **Current Status:** Backend starts successfully without import errors. Frontend logs in, fetches user data, and successfully fetches and processes initial data for the Living Map from `/api/v1/map/data` endpoint.

**Challenges & Learnings:**

*   Inconsistent refactoring is a major source of cascading errors. Systematic checks are crucial.
*   SQLAlchemy relationship configuration (`back_populates`, `foreign_keys`) requires careful attention to avoid runtime errors.
*   Pydantic V1 (`orm_mode`) vs V2 (`from_attributes`) configuration differences must be handled correctly.
*   CORS errors in the frontend can often be symptoms of underlying backend errors (like 500s).
*   Confirming frontend API URLs match Docker port mappings is essential.

**Next Steps (Continue Living Map Implementation - Slice 2 MVP):**

*   Investigate why newly created projects might not be immediately visible (potentially needs frontend state update or map refresh logic after creation).
*   Implement frontend display/rendering for different node types (Project, Goal, etc.) on the map.
*   Refine backend `/map/data` endpoint logic for fetching relevant nodes/edges.
*   Implement Google OAuth token refresh logic.
*   Add more robust authorization checks to backend endpoints.
*   Address `TODO` comments.

## Session Summary - April 21st, 2025

**Goal:** Complete Slice 2 frontend tasks for the Living Map MVP, including map interactions, briefing panel population, and basic project creation/note taking.

**Overall Progress:**

*   **Living Map Component (`LivingMap.tsx`):**
    *   Replaced initial `dagre` layout with `elkjs` for better layout options (experimented with `layered`, `force`, `mrtree`).
    *   Implemented map interactions: Pan/Zoom (FE-TASK-044 via React Flow defaults), Hover effects with tooltips (FE-TASK-045), Click handling feeding `BriefingPanel` (FE-TASK-046), and visual node selection state.
    *   Added `GoalNode.tsx` component and registered it.
*   **Briefing Panel (`BriefingPanel.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented logic to fetch and display details for selected User, Team, Project, and Goal nodes.
    *   Added fetching and display for related items:
        *   User -> Projects & Goals (FE-TASK-048).
        *   Team -> Owned Projects & Associated Goals (FE-TASK-049).
        *   Project -> Participants & Notes (FE-TASK-050).
    *   Refactored panel display using Chakra UI `Card` components for better structure and visual appeal.
    *   Implemented note submission UI and logic (FE-TASK-053).
    *   Added visual placeholder for adding project participants (FE-TASK-054).
*   **Backend Support:**
    *   Added CRUD functions and API endpoints to support fetching related items for the Briefing Panel (`/users/{id}/projects`, `/users/{id}/goals`, `/teams/{id}/projects`, `/teams/{id}/goals`, `/projects/{id}/participants`).
    *   Defined association table (`project_participants`) and updated model relationships (`Project`, `User`).
    *   Generated and applied Alembic migration for the association table.
*   **Authentication & Routing:**
    *   Diagnosed frontend rendering issues (blank screen, missing user menu) caused by auth state/flow problems.
    *   Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component to guard the `/map` route and correctly handle redirects to `/login` if not authenticated.
    *   Resolved persistent `useAuth` import issues in `ProtectedRoute`.
*   **Debugging & Fixes:**
    *   Systematically diagnosed and fixed numerous backend 500 errors and frontend CORS errors related to:
        *   Missing `tenant_id` arguments in CRUD calls (`CRUDProject.get`).
        *   Incorrect function calls (`get_multi_by_project` vs `get_notes_by_project`).
        *   Pydantic `ResponseValidationError` due to schema mismatches (`NoteRead` missing `owner_id`).
        *   SQLAlchemy relationship loading (`selectinload`, `AttributeError: 'KnowledgeAsset' has no attribute 'owner'`).
        *   Database query errors (`DISTINCT` on JSON columns).
        *   Model attribute errors (`Project has no attribute 'owner_id'`).
        *   Schema definition/export errors (`GoalReadMinimal`, `UserReadBasic` imports).
    *   Fixed frontend type issues (`Goal` type inheritance, Avatar `src` prop).
    *   Resolved `BriefingPanel` display issue ("Data structure mismatch") by improving type guards.
*   **Cleanup:**
    *   Removed outdated TODOs from `LivingMap.tsx` (GEN-TASK-001 started).
    *   Fixed ESLint `exhaustive-deps` warning in `LivingMap.tsx` by separating selection styling effect from layout effect.

**Challenges & Learnings:**

*   Backend errors often manifest as CORS errors in the frontend, requiring careful log checking on both sides.
*   Tenant isolation logic (`tenant_id` checks) needs to be consistently applied across CRUD operations and endpoints.
*   SQLAlchemy relationship loading (`selectinload`) and Pydantic schema validation (`from_attributes`, `computed_field`) require careful coordination.
*   Database-specific limitations (e.g., `DISTINCT` on JSON) can necessitate query adjustments (explicit column selection).
*   Frontend state management for authentication (`AuthContext`) needs robust handling of initial loading, token validation (`/users/me`), and error states to prevent UI inconsistencies.
*   Protected routing is essential for SPA applications to handle unauthenticated access correctly.
*   Tooling issues (module resolution cache, automated edits) can slow down debugging; restarts and manual verification are sometimes needed.

**Next Steps (Continue Slice 2):**

*   Complete remaining cleanup tasks (GEN-TASK-001, GEN-TASK-002, GEN-TASK-003), including fixing the kebab-case warning and using env vars for API URL.
*   Implement Daily Briefing feature (FE-TASK-051), requiring backend Google Calendar integration.
*   Implement UI/logic for adding/removing project participants.
*   Refine map data fetching and layout further.
*   Add missing note metadata (author, timestamp).
