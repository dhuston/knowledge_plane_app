## Development Guidelines

### Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Planning

1. **Determine the Scope:**
   - Understand all use cases, features, and functionalities required for the work
   - Document these use cases and any constraints or dependencies
   - Identify potential risks and mitigations

2. **Break Down into Tasks:**
   - Decompose the scope into granular tasks or modules
   - List out the expected inputs, processes, and outputs for each task
   - For each subtask, clearly define success criteria
   - Identify dependencies between tasks

3. **Create the Implementation Plan:**
   - Define a step-by-step execution approach for each subtask
   - Use concise, actionable steps that can serve as a checklist during development
   - Save the detailed plan in a markdown file
   - Get feedback on the plan before beginning implementation

#### Phase 2: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. **Initial Test Writing:**
   - For each task, write tests based on the expected input/output pairs
   - Focus on meaningful scenarios, covering both positive cases (expected behavior) and negative cases (edge or error scenarios)
   - Avoid creating mock implementations, even for functionality that does not exist yet in the codebase

2. **Run the Tests:**
   - Execute the written tests and confirm that they fail (to ensure the tests are working as intended)
   - Verify that the tests fail for the expected reasons

3. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Write only the minimal amount of code required to pass the test case
   - Avoid writing excess or speculative code
   - Iterate incrementally—one test case at a time

4. **Refinement and Generalization:**
   - Once the tests pass, refactor the code for clarity, performance, and maintainability
   - Ensure not to overfit implementation to the specific test cases
   - Aim for general, scalable solutions

5. **Final Verification:**
   - Run all tests to ensure they pass successfully
   - Conduct a self-review of the implementation
   - Document any notable decisions or trade-offs

### Critical Implementation Requirements

1. **Never Use Mock Data:**
   - All features must use real data from the backend API
   - Do not create or use mock data generators
   - If an API endpoint fails or returns no data, handle the error gracefully
   - Log errors properly for troubleshooting

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Fallback Options:**
   - Don't implement complex fallbacks that mask real issues
   - Handle errors directly rather than cascading through multiple fallback mechanisms
   - Fail fast and explicitly when required services are unavailable
   - Make service dependencies clear and avoid hiding them behind fallbacks

3. **API-First Development:**
   - Backend API endpoints should be implemented before frontend features
   - Frontend components should always connect to real API endpoints
   - Use proper error handling and loading states instead of fallback mock data
   - Test with real data flows in development environments

### Fundamental Development Principles

1. **Work Checklist:**
   - Maintain a continuous reference and checklist for each task
   - Track implementation progress systematically
   - Verify completion of all requirements before submitting work
   - Document any assumptions or design decisions made

2. **Core Design Principles:**
   - **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prioritize simplicity over complexity
   - **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication
   - **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** Don't add functionality until it's necessary
   - **SOLID:** Apply single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion principles

3. **No Premature Optimization:**
   - Focus on correct, testable functionality first
   - Optimize only after profiling identifies actual bottlenecks
   - Document performance considerations but implement them only when necessary
   - Let measured data drive optimization decisions

4. **Single Responsibility Focus:**
   - Files should do one thing well
   - Avoid files that require extensive scrolling to understand
   - Split files with multiple unrelated responsibilities
   - Ensure files can be named concisely to reflect their purpose
   - Files should be easy to test in isolation

### Code Style & Standards

1. **Python Import Structure:**
   ```python
   # Import standard Python modules first
   import os
   import sys
   from typing import List, Optional

   # Import third-party modules
   import fastapi
   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   # Import local modules
   from app.core import security
   from app.models.user import User
   from app.schemas.user import UserCreate
   ```

2. **React/TypeScript Best Practices:**
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Leverage React.memo for optimized renders
   - Implement proper type definitions
   - Follow the component structure defined in the project

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Use memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Implement virtualization for large lists
   - Apply lazy loading for non-critical components

2. **Frontend Testing:**
   - Component tests using React Testing Library
   - Visual regression tests for UI components
   - Performance tests for critical interactions
   - End-to-end tests for key user flows
   - Use API stubs with realistic data, never mock data generators

3. **Data Requirements:**
   - Test with realistic datasets that match production patterns
   - Never use randomly generated mock data
   - Test failure scenarios with proper API error responses
   - Maintain test fixtures that represent real-world use cases

4. **Testing Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd backend
   poetry run python -m pytest
